## Overview

When a monitoring system detects a problem — high CPU, a security breach, a failed service — the platform ingests the alert, normalizes it from multiple sources, and deduplicates it to prevent noise. It then creates an actionable incident, tracks its full lifecycle from detection to resolution, and automatically notifies the on-call engineer via Slack DM and email (SMS is added on escalation). If no one responds in time, the incident escalates automatically through a configurable chain. Every state change is recorded in a centralized audit log, and resolved incidents trigger an AI-generated postmortem draft.

**The goal**: reduce the time between "something broke" and "someone is fixing it."

The system is built for **multiple tenants** — each organization's data is fully isolated at every layer: HTTP, Kafka, and database.

### What the platform covers

- **Alert ingestion** from Prometheus, Wazuh, and generic sources with normalization and 5-layer deduplication
- **Incident lifecycle** managed by a finite state machine: `OPEN → ACKNOWLEDGED → RESOLVED → CLOSED` (escalation is tracked separately as an `escalationLevel` attribute, not as a lifecycle state — an incident can be escalated while `ACKNOWLEDGED`)
- **Automatic escalation** through a severity-calibrated chain: PRIMARY → SECONDARY → MANAGER
- **Multi-channel notifications** via Slack Bot Token (direct messages), email (Mailtrap SMTP), and SMS
- **AI-generated postmortems** via Gemini API triggered automatically on incident resolution
- **Centralized audit log** — every event across all services assembled into a single chronological timeline per incident
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket (STOMP) for live incident dashboards
- **Full observability** — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, structured JSON logs with MDC context collected in Loki

---

## Architecture

The platform follows a **microservices architecture** with event-driven communication via Apache Kafka. Each service has a single responsibility and communicates asynchronously.

## Design Decisions

**Why a custom FSM instead of Spring State Machine?**
Spring State Machine adds significant complexity and weight. A simple `Map<IncidentStatus, Set<IncidentStatus>>` of allowed transitions is transparent, easily testable, and sufficient for this use case. The FSM is covered by 25 parameterized test cases for all allowed and forbidden transitions.

**Why CQRS without separate databases?**
Full CQRS with read replicas is overkill here. The lightweight split between `IncidentCommandService` and `IncidentQueryService` within the same PostgreSQL instance demonstrates understanding of the pattern without unnecessary infrastructure complexity.

**Why `@Scheduled` for escalation instead of Kafka Streams?**
Kafka Streams would require windowing, state stores, and a significantly more complex setup. `@Scheduled` with a PostgreSQL-backed `EscalationTask` table is transparent, testable with Mockito, and sufficient. ShedLock prevents duplicate execution when the service scales to multiple replicas.

**Why no Gemini SDK?**
Using the raw HTTP API via `RestClient` through a `GeminiClient` interface keeps the integration vendor-neutral — switching to a different AI provider requires changing exactly one class. It also makes the HTTP contract explicit and debuggable without additional Maven dependencies.

**Why HS512 for JWT instead of RS256 or Keycloak?**
HS512 with a shared secret is sufficient for a controlled environment where all services are owned by the same team. Service tokens are minted and cached per tenant and per target service by `ServiceTokenProvider` (a concrete class, not an interface) and verified in `JwtAuthFilter`; moving to RS256 or Keycloak means changing token issuance in `JwtUtils`/`ServiceTokenProvider` and verification in `JwtAuthFilter`, both in `shared`. The tradeoff is documented and understood: every service holds the same secret, so any service can mint a token for any tenant and audience (backlog #0-13 records the asymmetric-key / mTLS alternative).

**Why Slack Bot Token instead of Incoming Webhook?**
Incoming Webhooks can only post to a single channel. Bot Token (`xoxb-`) with `chat.postMessage` sends direct messages to the on-call engineer's Slack User ID, and — only if the tenant turns on broadcast for its workspace — also a post to that tenant's own default channel. Each tenant connects its own workspace: an admin pastes the bot token into `POST /api/v1/slack-workspace` (auth-service stores it encrypted; there is no "Add to Slack" OAuth flow yet), and notification-service reads it per notification over a service-token call to auth-service (backlog #0-21/#0-30). A tenant with no workspace simply gets no Slack channel. **No ACK from Slack for now** (backlog #0-35): Slack signs a button click with the signing secret of the App that posted the message, and with a pasted token that App is the tenant's own, while `SlackSignatureVerifier` checks one platform-wide `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`. Messages therefore carry no Acknowledge button; incidents are acknowledged in the app. The callback endpoint (`/api/v1/slack/actions` → `IncidentAckClient`) is kept for the OAuth "Add to Slack" install, where every workspace uses the platform's App and the platform secret is correct.

**Why a centralized audit log via Kafka instead of per-service history tables?**
Per-service history tables scatter the timeline across databases and require multi-service HTTP calls to reconstruct a full incident view. The `audit.events` topic acts as a single audit stream — any service publishes events and the consumer assembles them into a unified chronological view via one API endpoint. A producer does not send to Kafka from inside its database transaction: it writes the event to its own outbox table in that transaction, and a relay sends it afterwards, at least once; the consumer drops a resend by the event's id (backlog #0-84, every service that records audit events).

**Why per-record TenantContext in Kafka listeners instead of the consumer interceptor?**
`TenantKafkaConsumerInterceptor.onConsume()` receives an entire batch — setting TenantContext from the first record would contaminate subsequent records from different tenants. Resolving the tenant per record in each `@KafkaListener` (`TenantKafkaRecordResolver`: the payload's valid tenant, which the `X-Tenant-Id` header must match) guarantees correctness regardless of batch composition. The interceptor is kept as a validation layer only.

**Why Consumer-Driven Contracts for notification-service?**
The notification consumer deserializes Kafka messages to `JsonNode` and extracts only the fields it needs. This decouples the consumer from the exact producer schema — a producer adding new fields to `IncidentOpenedEvent` won't break notification-service.

**How does a consumer treat a record it cannot process?**
Every consumer listens in `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE` mode and decides each record's fate itself, through `DeadLetterPublisher` (`shared`, backlog #0-96). A record that fails the same way every time (a poison pill) is copied to the service's dead-letter topic and acknowledged only once Kafka has the copy; if Kafka does not take it, the record is `nack`ed and read again. A transient failure (`KafkaFailures`: the database unreachable, timed out or a lost version race, in any of the types Spring gives it) is `nack`ed and read again after 5 s; the records after it on the partition wait, so order is kept and consumer lag shows the stall. Leaving a record unacknowledged is never a retry: the next record's acknowledgement commits the offset past it (shown on a real broker by `DeadLetterPublisherKafkaIntegrationTest`), which is how the consumers used to lose records on a transient failure. Anything else is a poison pill (backlog #47). A dead-letter reason and its log line carry a message only when the platform wrote it content-free (a refused tenant, an unknown severity, unparseable JSON); any other exception is named by its type and the platform's line that threw it (`KafkaFailures.reason`), never its message, which may quote the record. Every wait is bounded: a copy waits at most 5 s in all (its own producer blocks at most 2 s for metadata), each consumer refuses to start unless a poll of such waits fits in half of `max.poll.interval.ms` (120 s; 300 s in notification-service), a record still failing after `kafka.consumer.redelivery-deadline` (30 min) is dead-lettered instead of holding its partition, and a copy's original payload is cut to 128 KiB so it always fits in a record. `ingestion-service` has an HTTP request, not a record: it starts a request's copies together, waits for them under one 5 s deadline and answers 503 with `Retry-After` if Kafka does not take them, so the sender retries; the dedup keys of alerts a lost copy was to keep are released first. Moving the consumers onto Spring Kafka's `DefaultErrorHandler` with a dead-letter recoverer, and replaying dead letters, is backlog #0-97.

**Why bucket4j backed by Redis instead of in-memory rate limiting?**
This reverses an earlier in-memory design. In-memory buckets were per-pod (each replica kept independent counters, so the effective limit multiplied with the replica count) and were held in unbounded maps keyed by tenant and IP — a memory-exhaustion vector, since the client IP comes from the caller-controlled `X-Forwarded-For` header. `RateLimitingService` now keeps bucket state in Redis through bucket4j's `ProxyManager` (`bucket4j-redis`): state is shared across replicas and expires automatically. The Redis call is protected by `@CircuitBreaker` (backlog #67) and fails open, matching the dedup layer's policy for the same dependency. auth-service has the two limiters that fail closed: the platform API's (`PlatformRateLimiter`, backlog #0-83) and the admin MFA reset's (`MfaResetRateLimiter`, backlog #0-88). Both guard rare, privileged security actions, so while Redis cannot be checked, tenant provisioning and admin MFA resets answer 503 — those writes depend on Redis, logins and every other auth-service API do not.

**Why auth-service is a modular monolith rather than split into auth + identity?**
All identity concerns (users, teams, API keys, integrations) are colocated with authentication to avoid distributed transaction complexity and HTTP latency on the login hot path. `AuthService.login()` reads `User` credentials in the same database transaction — after splitting this would require a Redis credential cache (Wzorzec B) and Outbox Pattern for invite flow. This is documented as a future backlog item in `AuthServiceApplication.java` with the exact migration plan.

**Why API Key authentication uses SHA-256 instead of Argon2?**
API keys have ~143 bits of entropy (24 bytes SecureRandom → base64). Brute-forcing a leaked SHA-256 hash requires 2^143 attempts — computationally infeasible regardless of hash speed. Argon2's memory-hard cost (100ms+) would add latency to every API request that uses key authentication. SHA-256 is the industry standard for high-entropy API key hashing (GitHub, Stripe, Twilio).

**Why Integration-based routing instead of label matching for alert → team routing?**
Label-based routing (RoutingRules matching on alert labels) requires DevOps teams to configure labels in Prometheus/Wazuh per alert. Integration-based routing (PagerDuty model) delegates routing responsibility to the platform: admin creates an Integration named "Prometheus Payment API" → assigns it to "backend-team" → gets an API key. Alertmanager uses that key — the source of the alert IS the routing decision. No per-alert label configuration needed.

**Why a separate oncall-service instead of extending notification-service?**
On-call schedule management is a distinct bounded context. A separate service allows independent scaling, independent deployment, and future extension (PagerDuty integration, calendar sync) without touching the notification pipeline.

**Why tenants are created by a platform operator through an API, not by a seed or configuration?**
A multi-tenant platform onboards customers while it runs. A Flyway seed gave every database the same admin with a known password (backlog #0-80), and a configuration entry per tenant would need a deployment change and a restart for each customer. Instead an admin of the reserved `platform-operator` tenant calls `POST /api/v1/platform/tenants`: the tenant row, its first admin (no password) and the invite email are written in one transaction, and the admin sets their own password by accepting the invite. It is the platform's one cross-tenant capability, kept narrow on purpose: create, reissue the first invite while the tenant has no admin, show and list metadata, suspend and resume a tenant (backlog #0-82), and, as the single exception inside a tenant that has an admin, the delayed, announced MFA recovery of its only admin (backlog #0-90); JWT only, no API keys, a recent MFA login with an established factor (backlog #0-83); audited in both tenants. It reverses backlog #0-16's "no cross-tenant create tenant endpoint" for customer tenants only; the operator tenant still bootstraps itself.

## Resilience & Security

### Alert Deduplication — 5 Independent Layers

No single layer failure results in duplicate incidents. Each layer independently catches what the others miss.

| Layer | Mechanism | Protects against |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Redis SETNX, 5-minute TTL | Burst of duplicate alerts |
| 2 | Redis EXPIRE 7 days on `IncidentOpenedEvent` | Alert flood during active incident |
| 3 | Redis DEL on `IncidentResolvedEvent` | Stale dedup block after resolution |
| 4 | Redis AOF persistence | Dedup state loss on Redis restart |
| 5 | `incident-service` fingerprint check in PostgreSQL | Redis unavailability, race conditions |

### Escalation Chain

When an incident is not acknowledged, escalation follows a structured chain with timeouts calibrated to severity:

```
T+0:    Incident OPEN  → IncidentOpenedEvent                      → Email + Slack
T+5m*:  No ACK         → Level 1 (SECONDARY) IncidentEscalatedEvent → Email + Slack + SMS
T+10m*: Still no ACK   → Level 2 (MANAGER)   IncidentEscalatedEvent → Email + Slack + SMS
        (* CRITICAL — HIGH=15m, MEDIUM=30m, LOW=60m per level)
```

The channel set is chosen by **event type**, not by escalation level (`NotificationRouter`): `INCIDENT_OPENED` → Email + Slack, `INCIDENT_ESCALATED` → Email + Slack + SMS, `INCIDENT_ACKNOWLEDGED` → Slack, `INCIDENT_RESOLVED` → Email + Slack, `INCIDENT_CLOSED` → Email.

escalation-service resolves the SECONDARY (level 1) or MANAGER (level 2) on-call user through oncall-service and puts that user in `IncidentEscalatedEvent.escalateTo`. notification-service stores `escalateTo` and the escalation level on its outbox entry, and each escalation level is now queued and sent at most once per channel (idempotency is keyed on incident + tenant + event type + escalation level, so the level-2 notification is no longer discarded as a duplicate of level 1). `escalationLevel` is required and must be an integer in 1..2; anything else is routed to `notification.dead-letter` rather than queued. A malformed `escalateTo` is ignored with a warning, not dead-lettered. When an entry is sent, `NotificationRouter` notifies the `escalateTo` user: it looks up that user's current on-call entry in oncall-service (`GET /api/v1/oncall/current/by-user/{userId}`, tenant and user id matched together) and uses their email, Slack id and phone. If there is no target, or the target is not on call, the escalation goes to the tenant's PRIMARY on-call as before. Other event types notify the PRIMARY on-call, resolved with the incident's `teamId` when it has one (falling back to tenant-wide otherwise, backlog #0-12) — the same team-scoped lookup the escalation fallback uses. **Tenant content only reaches members of that tenant** (the on-call contact details are entered by the tenant and are not verified against membership yet, backlog #0-24): there is no fallback address. A channel the on-call user has no address for is skipped (a WARN and `notification.channel_skipped{channel,event_type}`; a Slack id must start with `U`, anything else is no Slack address), and if nobody in the tenant can be notified the queue entry becomes `UNDELIVERABLE`; it is counted in `notification.undeliverable{event_type,reason}`, audited for the tenant as `NOTIFICATION_UNDELIVERABLE` (a type of its own, distinct from `NOTIFICATION_FAILED`, a failed send), and for opened and escalated incidents the platform operator gets a content-free email (tenant id, incident id, event type, reason) at `NOTIFICATION_OPERATOR_ALERT_EMAIL`. That address has no default: if it is unset no email is sent and only the ERROR log and the metric remain, so set it for every environment (the Kubernetes ConfigMap `app-config` carries an empty `NOTIFICATION_OPERATOR_ALERT_EMAIL`; each overlay patches it — dev mirrors docker-compose's Mailpit address, staging/prod carry a placeholder to replace before a real deployment, backlog #0-26). Alerts are limited to one email per tenant and reason per `NOTIFICATION_OPERATOR_ALERT_MIN_INTERVAL` (default `PT15M`). If oncall-service cannot answer, the entry stays `PENDING` and is retried until the lookup has been failing for `NOTIFICATION_LOOKUP_RETRY_WINDOW` (default `PT10M`, measured from the first failed lookup and not from creation) before it becomes `UNDELIVERABLE`; a run of the scheduler loads at most `NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULER_BATCH_SIZE` entries (default `200`, oldest first) and stops after `NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULER_PROCESSING_BUDGET` (default `PT3M`; it must stay below the 4-minute lock, which is checked at startup). escalation-service's run stops after `ESCALATION_SCHEDULER_PROCESSING_BUDGET` (default `PT4M`, below its 5-minute lock) and postmortem-service's after `POSTMORTEM_GENERATING_PROCESSING_BUDGET` / `POSTMORTEM_RETRY_PROCESSING_BUDGET` (`PT3M` / `PT8M`, below 4 and 9 minutes), both checked at startup; the three services sync their paused tenants every `TENANT_PAUSE_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS` (default `10000`, backlog #0-82). SMTP calls have 5-second timeouts (`MAIL_SMTP_*_TIMEOUT_MS`). Slack is per tenant (backlog #0-21): each tenant's own workspace, bot token, default channel and broadcast flag (off by default) come from auth-service, cached for 60 s. A tenant without a workspace has Slack skipped like any other missing address. If auth-service cannot answer, only Slack is skipped and the other channels go out (counted in `service_client_fallback_total{client="slack-workspace"}`); when Slack was the only reachable channel the entry stays `PENDING` within the same retry window and then becomes `UNDELIVERABLE` with reason `SLACK_WORKSPACE_UNAVAILABLE`. A failed send is recorded by its reason, the platform's words (`NotificationFailureReason`: a rejected address, an unreachable mail server, a Slack code such as `not_in_channel`), never the mail server's or Slack's own text, and counted in `notification.channel.failed{channel,reason}` (a refused Slack broadcast under `channel="SLACK_BROADCAST"`, since it no longer stops the on-call DM) (backlog #0-93); Slack's `"ok": false`, which it answers with HTTP 200, is a failure (until #0-93 it was recorded as sent). A failed channel send is not retried later (backlog #0-32).

Each escalation level creates an independent `EscalationTask` in PostgreSQL. ACK at any point cancels all pending tasks. ShedLock prevents duplicate job execution across multiple replicas. The escalation level is written back to the incident by incident-service, which consumes `IncidentEscalatedEvent` from `incidents.lifecycle`.

- **JWT secret**: No default value — application refuses to start without `JWT_SECRET` set explicitly
- **Service-to-service auth**: `ServiceTokenProvider.getToken(tenantId, audience)` generates and caches one JWT per tenant and target service with `ROLE_SERVICE`; `JwtAuthFilter` authenticates it as a `ServicePrincipal` only in the service named in its `aud` claim (auth-service accepts only `aud=auth-service`, on its two internal endpoints: a tenant's Slack workspace — backlog #0-30 — and a tenant's status, read by every other service — backlog #0-82) and takes the tenant only from the signed `tenantId` claim, never from `X-Tenant-Id` — not exposed to end users. Client fallbacks that fail open are counted in `service_client_fallback_total{client,target,reason}`; `reason="auth"` means a 401/403, i.e. a misconfiguration and not an outage
- **Alert source authentication** (backlog #0-16): external alert sources — a tenant's Alertmanager, Wazuh, and the platform's own Alertmanager (as the reserved `platform-operator` tenant) — send an Integration API key (`Authorization: ApiKey ipl_…` or `Bearer ipl_…`). ingestion-service sends only its SHA-256 to auth-service's introspection endpoint, with a tenant-less *purpose token* that auth-service accepts on that one route and nowhere else, and caches active keys for at most 60 s (the revocation window). A definite "no" is `401`; "can't check right now" is `503` + `Retry-After`, because Alertmanager retries 5xx but drops every 4xx. A valid key of a tenant suspended read-only also gets `503`, with `Retry-After: 300` and `TENANT_READ_ONLY` (its alerts are paused, not refused); a tenant suspended in full gets `403` + `TENANT_SUSPENDED`, which is not counted as a failed authentication (backlog #0-82). A key cached as active before a suspension is caught by the status filter within 10 s. ingestion-service accepts no service tokens. Tenant ids `platform-operator` and `system` are reserved
- **Dev endpoints**: `DevTokenController` (`GET /dev/token`, an unauthenticated token for any tenant and role) is gated with `@Profile({"local", "dev"})`, plus a startup guard that refuses to run outside those profiles. The guard cannot help if a deployment sets the dev profile itself, which the k8s base ConfigMap did for every overlay, prod included (backlog #0-63). Now only `k8s/overlays/dev` sets `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`, docker-compose sets none, and CI fails if the rendered staging or prod overlay sets any Spring profile
- **Management port isolation**: Prometheus metrics and health endpoints on separate ports (8091–8097) — never co-located with the business API
- **API key security**: Gemini API key passed via `x-goog-api-key` HTTP header — never embedded in URLs where it could appear in access logs
- **Sensitive field redaction**: `GlobalExceptionHandler` redacts `password`, `secret`, `token`, `apiKey` from validation error responses
- **Slack Bot Token**: Minimal OAuth scopes (`chat:write`, `im:write`) — principle of least privilege
- **Request size limits**: `ingestion-service` rejects payloads over 1MB — protection against DoS via oversized alerts

### Concurrency Safety

- **Optimistic locking**: `@Version` on `Incident` entity — concurrent PATCH requests return `HTTP 409 Conflict` instead of silently overwriting
- **Notification idempotency**: `notification-service` checks `notification_queue` (incident + tenant + event type + escalation level) before enqueueing and `notification_log` (same key + channel) before sending — Kafka at-least-once delivery never causes duplicate Slack messages or emails. One accepted exception (backlog #0-103): a Slack post retried after a timeout or a 5xx (`SlackApiClient`, 3 attempts, its own 3 s connect / 5 s read timeouts; the scheduler checks at startup that its processing budget leaves the lock room for a send's worst case, so raising `SLACK_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `SLACK_RETRY_WAIT_MS`, `SLACK_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` or `SLACK_READ_TIMEOUT` may need a lower `NOTIFICATION_SCHEDULER_PROCESSING_BUDGET`, or the service refuses to start) may show twice, as Slack takes no idempotency key — a duplicate beats a lost incident message. The Slack calls sit behind a circuit breaker (backlog #0-104): once Slack keeps timing out or answering 5xx, Slack messages fail at once (`SLACK_UNAVAILABLE`, `circuit_open`) instead of costing every entry about 51 s, and are not resent (#0-32); alert `SlackCircuitOpen` while it keeps refusing them
- **Audit event resilience**: every service that records audit events (auth-, incident-, notification-, escalation-, postmortem-service) writes them to a transactional outbox, sent by a relay with backoff (backlog #0-84) — a Kafka outage blocks no request and loses no event

### Multi-Tenant Kafka — Per-Record Isolation

All Kafka topics are multi-tenant. A record's tenant is the `tenantId` in its payload; its `X-Tenant-Id` header is a copy, written by one helper (`TenantRecords`) that every sender uses, so code that does not parse the payload (MDC, metrics, dead-letter tooling) can read it (backlog #0-91). `TenantKafkaProducerInterceptor`, registered in every service that produces, only checks that the header is there and valid. Each `@KafkaListener` resolves the tenant per record (`TenantKafkaRecordResolver`: the payload's valid tenant, which the header must be there to match, else the record is dead-lettered and counted, backlog #0-92) and clears `TenantContext` in a `finally` block — guaranteeing no tenant leaks between records in the same batch. Every tenant id is a slug (`TenantIds`), so none can carry anything into a log line, a header or a metric tag.

## Infrastructure Hardening

What protects the platform around its application code, area by area, with what is still missing at the end.
It is an inventory from the security audit of 2026-09-30: every item says where it lives, so it can be checked
against the code. Application-level controls are described in detail in [Resilience & Security](#resilience--security);
the summary below only places them.

### GitHub and CI

What protects the pipeline itself: the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the secrets and `main`. Part of it lives in
the workflow files, part in repository settings, which no diff shows, so the settings are listed here
too (state as of 2026-09-29; check them with `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/...` after changing anything
in Settings).

**In the workflow files**

- **Token scope declared per workflow** (backlog #0-59): every workflow starts from
  `permissions: contents: read`, and only the job that needs more widens its own token —
  `detect-changes` adds `pull-requests: read` (`dorny/paths-filter` lists a PR's files through the
  API), the two Snyk jobs add `security-events: write` (SARIF upload). Every scope not listed is `none`.
- **No write scope for PR code**: jobs that run a PR's own code (build, tests, Docker builds, smoke
  test) keep the read-only token. That is why the coverage report goes to the job summary rather than
  a PR comment, which would need `pull-requests: write` (backlog #0-57).
- **`pull_request`, never `pull_request_target`**: a PR from a fork runs with a read-only token and
  without the repository's secrets.
- **Secrets only through `secrets.*`** (`SNYK_TOKEN`, `NVD_API_KEY`), in the scan workflows, which
  run only on `main`, on a schedule or by hand — never on a PR.
- **Actions pinned by commit SHA** (backlog #0-60): every `uses:` names the full 40-character
  commit, with its tag in a comment (`actions/checkout@<sha> # v4.4.0`). A tag can be repointed by
  whoever controls the action's repository, as in the `tj-actions/changed-files` compromise
  (CVE-2025-30066), and the next run would execute that code with the job's token and secrets; a SHA
  cannot. Renovate's `helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests` preset updates the SHA and the comment together.
- **No token left in `.git/config`** (backlog #0-60): every `actions/checkout` sets
  `persist-credentials: false`. No job pushes, so no later step needs the token that checkout would
  otherwise leave behind for it to read.
- **Scan tools pinned and verified before they receive a secret** (backlog #0-61): the Snyk CLI is
  the standalone binary at the version pinned in `snyk.yml`, checked against the SHA-256 kept next to
  it. A different binary stops the job before `SNYK_TOKEN` exists in any process. The token reaches
  only the scan step, as the `SNYK_TOKEN` environment variable the CLI reads itself; there is no
  `snyk auth`, which put the token in the process arguments and in a config file every later step
  could read. This replaced `npm install -g snyk`: whatever version npm served at that moment, a Node
  wrapper whose unbundled `@sentry/node ^7` dependency was resolved at install time. Version and
  checksum are bumped together by hand (Renovate cannot compute the checksum), as `diff-cover` is
  pinned in `ci.yml`; the checksum is committed only when Snyk's download server and the npm package
  of the same version agree on it, since the server alone also serves the binary. The CLI is
  installed without `sudo`, into the runner's temp directory.

**In repository settings**

- Workflow permissions default: **read** — a fallback only, since every workflow declares its own.
  GitHub Actions may not approve pull requests.
- Workflows from first-time contributors' fork PRs wait for approval before they run.
- Secret scanning with **push protection**: a push containing a recognised secret is rejected.
- Ruleset "Protect main": `main` cannot be deleted or force-pushed.
- Actions must be pinned to a full-length commit SHA (`sha_pinning_required`, backlog #0-60): a
  workflow with a tag-pinned `uses:` fails to start, so a tag no longer depends on review alone. It
  was turned on once `main` had no tag-pinned `uses:` left and its run was green (2026-09-29);
  turning it on earlier would have stopped every run on `main` from starting.
- Security scanning and dependency updates: see [Security Scanning](#security-scanning) and
  [Dependency Updates — Renovate](#dependency-updates--renovate) in CI/CD.

### AI factory (unattended agents)

Controls around the autopilot that implements `BACKLOG.md` items without a human in the loop
([docs/ai-factory.md](docs/ai-factory.md), backlog #0-113). The premise: an agent's instructions are not a
security boundary, so every rule that matters is also enforced outside the model.

- **Human-owned paths**: `.ai/rules/`, `.ai/plan/` (the approved order of work), `.claude/`, `.github/`, `architecture-tests/`, `AGENTS.md`, the gates'
  own files (`scripts/factory/`, `.devcontainer/`, `.mvn/`, `mvnw`) are denied to autopilot sessions for the file
  tools (`.claude/settings.autopilot.json`), guarded heuristically for the shell
  (`.claude/hooks/guard-protected-bash.sh`), stop an item before review when committed
  (`scripts/factory/changed-paths.sh`), and need the owner's review on a PR (`.github/CODEOWNERS`, effective
  once the protection rule requires it). Factory scripts run only while identical to `main`
  (`guard-factory-scripts.sh`).
- **Factory guards** (`.github/workflows/factory-guards.yml`): a PR that deletes, renames away or disables
  tests, removes assertions, adds a Maven plugin, repository or dependency, changes what verification runs
  (`.mvn/`, `mvnw`, skip properties, the coverage check's threshold, rule, goal, phase or includes), edits or deletes an applied Flyway migration, or marks a backlog item
  ready fails unless its author is the owner or the owner approved its current commit. The same workflow
  validates the execution queue against the backlog (`scripts/factory/check-queue.sh`).
- **The next item is chosen by code** (`scripts/factory/next-item.sh`), from the files on the run's base
  commit: only `ready` items, dependencies done, no open PR or branch, in the order of the owner-approved
  queue. Follow-ups an agent proposes enter as `proposed` and run only after the owner's `/ready`.
- **Skipping verification is refused** in autopilot sessions (`guard-tests.sh`: `-DskipTests`, `--no-verify`,
  `-fn`, `exec:` goals, another `settings.xml`, …), the test gate tests the committed HEAD of a clean tree with
  its own Maven settings (`scripts/factory/maven-settings.xml`, no `~/.mavenrc`, no `MAVEN_OPTS`: nothing an
  agent's code can write in the home directory decides what runs), the file tools of an autopilot session
  write only inside the repository (`guard-write-in-repo.sh`), and applied Flyway migrations cannot be edited through the file tools in any session (`guard-migrations.sh`).
  Hook tests: `.claude/hooks/test-hooks.sh`.
- **Least privilege per agent**: reviewers, the architect and the auditors run read-only Bash allow-lists
  and write scopes (`.claude/hooks/readonly-bash.sh`, `write-scope.sh`); every agent searches with `git grep`
  only, with an allow-list of options checked on the command as bash splits it (so no abbreviated or quoted
  `--untracked`, `--no-index`, `-f` or `-O`, no `$` expansion, no unquoted glob before `--`, no line
  continuation, which bash joins before running; the latter is refused in every autopilot command): tracked files
  only, so a gitignored secret is never read and no program is run; the
  autopilot session is `dontAsk`
  with an explicit allow-list; `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` are denied (an agent that reads untrusted text must not
  be able to send data out).
- **Network**: autopilot runs happen in the devcontainer (`.devcontainer/`), whose firewall allows only its
  own DNS resolver, the Anthropic API, GitHub, Maven Central and the Docker host over IPv4, closes IPv6 to all
  but loopback, and blocks all traffic if its own setup fails (`FIREWALL SETUP FAILED`). It narrows exfiltration, it
  does not prevent it: the host's Docker (needed by Testcontainers) and GitHub itself remain channels.
- **Merge**: shadow mode does not rely on the agents — `gh pr merge` is denied to autopilot sessions and the
  only push a hook allows is `git push -u origin <type>/<branch>`, until #0-113's bot account and branch
  protection exist. A red `main` opens an `autopilot-stop` issue (`.github/workflows/main-guard.yml`), which
  the preflight honours.

**Known gaps**: the GitHub settings themselves (#0-113); the devcontainer's firewall binds the agents' own
commands but not code they run, as Docker access (needed by Testcontainers) is root over the container
(#0-116, accepted for shadow mode, required before auto-merge); no secret scanning (#0-109); no Maven Enforcer
(#0-110); the shell guards are heuristics, the commit gates and the PR checks are the reliable lines;
subagent frontmatter hooks (the reviewers' read-only allow-lists) do not run in headless (`-p`) sessions,
where only the session-level hooks apply. Layers and their limits: docs/ai-factory.md, "What isolates what".

### Container images

- **Multi-stage builds**: each service's Dockerfile builds with the JDK image and ships only the JRE image
  (`eclipse-temurin:<version>-jre-alpine`) and the service jar, without Maven, sources or the build cache.
- **Non-root**: every image creates `appuser` and runs as `USER appuser`; the jar is owned by that user.
- **Pinned base images**: builder and runtime images carry an exact version tag, which Renovate updates (all
  Dockerfile updates grouped into one PR).
- **Container-aware JVM**: `-XX:+UseContainerSupport -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0`, so the heap follows the
  container's memory limit instead of the node's.

### Kubernetes

- **Secrets outside the ConfigMap**: `JWT_SECRET`, `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `DB_PASSWORD` come from the `app-secrets` Secret, one `secretKeyRef`
  per key, and each Deployment receives only the keys it uses (the MFA and Slack encryption keys reach only
  auth-service; `DB_PASSWORD` the six services that use the database). The Postgres superuser's credentials are a
  separate `postgresql-admin` Secret that only the database reads. The overlays' `secrets.yml` hold placeholders
  for staging and prod, with External Secrets or Sealed Secrets as the intended source.
- **Narrow Ingress**: routes only `/api/v1/*` and `/ws`. Actuator endpoints, the management ports, Swagger and
  `/dev/**` are not routed.
- **Rate limiting at the edge**: per-client-IP limits on the Ingress (`limit-rps`, `limit-rpm`,
  `limit-connections`), in front of the application's own bucket4j limits.
- **Resource limits and probes**: every Deployment sets CPU and memory requests and limits, and readiness and
  liveness probes on the management port.
- **No dev profile outside dev** (backlog #0-63): only `k8s/overlays/dev` sets `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`, and CI
  fails if the rendered staging or prod overlay sets any Spring profile. The base used to set `dev` for every
  overlay, which would have exposed incident-service's unauthenticated `/dev/token` in prod.
- **No profile configuration or literal secret in a jar** (backlog #0-81): CI fails on a committed
  `application-<profile>.*` under `*/src/main/resources`, a base `application.*` with a
  `spring.config.activate.on-profile` document or a `spring.profiles.active` / `include` / `default` / `group` (in a jar it
  would apply everywhere, past the manifest check above), or a secret, encryption key, private key or API key there
  (any key ending in `secret`, `encryption-key`, `private-key`, `api-key`, kebab or camelCase) that is not a `${VAR}`
  without default (`.github/scripts/check-packaged-profiles.sh`; postmortem-service's `gemini.api-key` lost its
  placeholder default for it). The `test` profiles, with a hard-coded JWT secret and MFA
  key, used to ship in three services' jars and images; a run with that profile outside the manifests would have
  used them, which the check above cannot see.
- **Schema validation**: CI renders base and all three overlays and validates them with `kubeconform -strict`.

### Data stores

- **Passwords and secrets at rest**: user passwords are Argon2 hashes; TOTP secrets and tenants' Slack bot tokens
  are encrypted with AES-GCM under two separate keys; Integration API keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes only;
  emailed credentials are never stored raw.
- **Schema changes only through migrations**: each service has its own Flyway history table and
  `ddl-auto: validate`, so an unmigrated change fails startup instead of altering the schema.
- **Redis persistence**: append-only file on, so revoked tokens and dedup keys survive a Redis restart.
- **No default database password**: `application.yml` reads `${DB_PASSWORD}` with no fallback, so a service
  without the password never connects with the dev one; when it is missing, Kubernetes (`secretKeyRef`) and
  compose (`${VAR:?}`) stop before the service starts. A CI step (`check-db-password-config.rb`, with a bypass
  test) fails unless every committed config sets the password to exactly `${DB_PASSWORD}` (backlog #0-66).
- **No superuser for the services**: they connect as `incident_app`, which owns the database but is not a superuser,
  cannot create roles or databases and is a member of no other role, so a SQL injection no longer reaches the
  container (`COPY ... TO PROGRAM`), the server's files or other roles directly. The image's superuser is for
  administration only and never touches anything outside `pg_catalog` in the database: service data, backups and restores go through an
  `incident_app` login, and the admin's `search_path` is `pg_catalog` (backlog #0-78,
  [docs/database-roles.md](docs/database-roles.md), "Working as the admin"). CI checks it twice: the "PostgreSQL Roles"
  job tests the init script and the migration of an older database against the real image, and after every
  migration has run as `incident_app` the smoke test checks the role's attributes and memberships and that
  `COPY ... TO PROGRAM` is refused.

### Application

Summary; details in [Resilience & Security](#security).

- **Authentication**: JWT HS512 with a secret of at least 64 bytes and no default; login brute-force protection
  (per tenant and email, 10-minute window, 15-minute lockout); TOTP MFA; revocation of refresh tokens.
- **No default accounts**: no migration seeds a user. A tenant's first admin is invited by email and sets their own
  password; the old seeded `admin@incidentplatform.com` / `changeme` is archived wherever its password was never
  changed (backlog #0-80).
- **Tenant provisioning**: the one cross-tenant capability. Only an admin of the `platform-operator` tenant with a
  JWT (no API key, service or purpose token) reaches `/api/v1/platform/**`, checked in auth-service's filter chain
  and on every method; it creates a tenant with an invited first admin, reissues that invite while the tenant has
  no admin, shows and lists tenants' metadata, suspends and resumes tenants, and asks for the MFA recovery of a
  customer tenant's only admin (both below), audited in the operator tenant. The Ingress routes it like
  every auth-service path, so that rule is its only protection (backlog #0-80,
  [docs/tenant-provisioning.md](docs/tenant-provisioning.md)). Since backlog #0-83 the caller's session must have
  completed MFA within 12 h, with a factor whose "MFA enabled" email went out at least 24 h ago (checked on the server per
  request, so logout or disabling MFA ends access at once). Writes are limited per operator and in total in Redis
  (fail-closed: 503 while Redis cannot be checked, unlike ingestion's fail-open limiter), and a provisioning
  spike (`PlatformTenantProvisioningSpike`) or a reached limit (`PlatformApiRateLimited`) alerts the operator
  by email; `PlatformApiRateLimitUnavailable` reports the Redis case.
- **MFA change notifications**: enabling or disabling MFA on any account emails the account's address (backlog
  #0-83), so an owner learns when someone else used their password to change the second factor. A password reset by
  email ends every session and unfinished login and revokes the personal API keys (backlog #0-89), but never
  touches the second factor (backlog #0-88), so a mailbox alone cannot undo MFA.
- **Admin MFA reset**: an admin of the tenant removes another user's factor, backup codes and every session
  (`POST /api/v1/users/{id}/mfa-reset`, backlog #0-88), for a lost phone or a factor someone else enrolled. Only
  from an admin session that passes the platform API's MFA rule (MFA within 12 h, a factor announced at least 24 h
  ago; a password-only session, a fresh factor or an API key gets 403), never on one's own account; the user gets
  an email of its own ("an administrator reset your MFA"), audited as `MFA_RESET_BY_ADMIN`. A deactivated user can be
  reset too (before reactivating an account with a stranger's factor). Limited per admin (10/h) and per tenant (30/h),
  counted only for a reset about to happen (after step-up, user lookup and factor check), fail-closed (503 while Redis cannot be checked); reaching it alerts the operator by
  email (`AdminMfaResetRateLimited`, critical). A single platform operator has no second
  admin: a one-off break-glass command of auth-service does the same reset, audited as `MFA_RESET_BREAK_GLASS` with
  the operator's name and reason, its event written to the audit outbox in the reset's transaction and sent
  before the command exits when Kafka is reachable
  ([docs/tenant-provisioning.md](docs/tenant-provisioning.md)). A customer tenant's only admin has the operator's
  MFA recovery instead (next item).
- **MFA recovery of a customer tenant's only admin** (backlog #0-90): the one action the platform takes inside a
  tenant that has an admin, the narrow exception to #0-80. An operator who passes the platform API's rule asks for
  it (`POST /api/v1/platform/tenants/{id}/mfa-recovery`, limited like the other platform writes) only for an
  active admin with MFA who is the tenant's only active admin, recording how the person was verified outside the
  account (method and note). Nothing happens then: the account is emailed a notice with a cancel link, and only
  once 72 h (configurable, never under 24 h) have passed since that email was actually sent does a scheduled job reset the factor, backup codes,
  sessions, personal API keys and the password (replaced by one nobody knows; the completion email carries a
  password-reset link), after checking again that no other admin exists and that the operator who asked is still
  an operator admin (a request from an account later deactivated does not run). A notice that never goes out
  expires the request. The account (single-use link, `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa-recovery/cancel`) or any operator can cancel.
  Audited in both tenants (`MFA_RECOVERY_*`; the operator's note only in the operator tenant), and every request
  and every cancellation by the account or on that final check alerts the operator by email
  (`PlatformMfaRecoveryRequested`, `PlatformMfaRecoveryCancelledByAccount`, `PlatformMfaRecoveryCancelledOnRecheck`,
  critical, counted only once their transaction commits; a second admin added during the wait may be the
  attacker's); an expired request raises `PlatformMfaRecoveryExpired` and one the scheduler keeps failing on
  `PlatformMfaRecoveryJobFailing`. The customer tenant's trail names an operator only as `platform-operator`. Prevention: tenant settings show `activeAdmins` and
  `singleAdmin`, so a tenant's admins see while one admin is all there is.
- **One definition of an active admin** (backlog #0-90): active, not archived, with an accepted invite. The "last
  admin" guard used to count an admin whose invite was pending, so the last admin who could log in could be
  demoted, deactivated or archived.
- **Tenant suspension** (backlog #0-82): an operator suspends a tenant (`POST /api/v1/platform/tenants/{id}/suspend`,
  `/resume`; a `SECURITY` reason requires `FULL`, also enforced by a CHECK; `platform-operator` itself cannot be
  suspended), in full (nothing works: every session ends at once, sign-ins, invites, password resets and API keys
  are refused, an access token already issued is refused in every service, and its live WebSocket sessions are
  closed) or read-only (reads go on,
  writes are 403 except account security: logout, password, MFA, and an admin revoking a key (one, or every key
  a user created) or an integration, deactivating a user or resetting their MFA, each listed with its HTTP method,
  reactivating a user refused; alerts are paused, not lost: ingestion-service answers them 503 +
  `Retry-After: 300` + `TENANT_READ_ONLY`, so Alertmanager retries them until the tenant is resumed; a full
  suspension's alerts get `403 TENANT_SUSPENDED`, not counted as a failed authentication of the sender's IP). The
  status lives in auth-service's `tenants` table (V30). Transitions take a row lock on the tenant (`FOR NO KEY UPDATE`,
  waits) before a status-guarded UPDATE, so two operators are serialised; sign-ins, invites and resets take a
  share lock on the same row, taken before any token is consumed (the suspension's order: tenant, then tokens), so a
  sign-in racing a full suspension either commits before the suspension's session cleanup or reads the suspension;
  it waits at most 3 s, then gets 503 + `Retry-After`; a suspension or resumption waits at most 5 s, and any
  request of auth-service that loses a lock (timeout, deadlock) gets 503 + `Retry-After`, not 500. A
  `TenantStatusFilter` from `shared`, added by `buildCommonSecurity` to every service's chain, refuses a suspended
  tenant's users and keys; auth-service answers it from its database, every other service asks auth-service
  (`GET /api/v1/internal/tenant-status`, a service token for that tenant, `aud=auth-service`) and keeps the answer
  10 s, one call per tenant at a time, so a suspension reaches every service within 10 s (step 2 of #0-82). If
  auth-service cannot answer, a service keeps each tenant's last known status however long the outage lasts
  (static stability), and gives full access only to a tenant it never had an answer for (fail-open, decided: an
  auth-service outage must not stop every tenant); counted and alerted (`TenantStatusLookupFailing`, and
  `TenantStatusLookupRejected`, critical, when auth-service refuses the service's token). CI fails a service that
  does not set `auth-service.base-url` (`check-tenant-status-config.sh`): without it the service would give every
  tenant full access. In incident-service a
  suspended tenant's STOMP `CONNECT` is refused and a sweep every 10 s closes the sessions it opened before; both
  read the status without waiting on auth-service, so its outage cannot tie up the WebSocket threads (alerts
  `WebSocketSessionUntracked` if a session cannot be tracked, `TenantStatusCacheFull` if the status cache is
  full).
  auth-service's public paths (login, refresh, MFA, invite, reset) check the status themselves, and a sign-in
  refused for it is audited (`USER_SIGN_IN_REFUSED_TENANT_SUSPENDED`, after the rollback) and counted
  (`auth_signin_refused_total`); past a few refusals per user in the brute-force window the answer is 429 with no
  event (a refusal rolls back, so its invite or reset token, or a right password, could be replayed without end). Nothing is deleted or revoked, so a resumed tenant works as before. Invites (and, in full,
  password-reset emails) wait while it lasts. The tenant's background work is paused in either mode and resumed
  with it (step 2b): notification-, escalation- and postmortem-service keep a table of paused tenants
  (`<service>_paused_tenants`), filled every 10 s by `PausedTenantsSync` (`shared`, ShedLock) from auth-service's own
  answer for the tenants with work waiting, never on a fail-open guess, so an auth-service outage neither pauses nor
  resumes anyone; their schedulers' queries leave those tenants out (in SQL, so a paused tenant's old rows cannot
  starve the others; the table name a constant checked against `tenant-pause.table` at startup) and ask `accessOf`
  per row in between (the status cache, asked of auth-service again when expired or never filled, so a restart does
  not let a suspended tenant's rows out), each batch's tenants looked up together first, 8 at a time and within
  the run's processing budget, so a slow auth-service does not delay the batch tenant after tenant. Nothing is sent, escalated or generated (no Gemini call) meanwhile; the
  Kafka consumers go on writing the rows, so resumption finds a consistent state. Escalation timers stop for the
  pause, measured from the suspension's own time (`suspended_at`, which auth-service now sends with the status as
  `since`), however late a service noticed it: the tenant could not acknowledge anything. Notifications are all sent
  on resumption, none dropped for age. The Slack ACK path (no button in messages since #0-21, back with #0-35) refuses
  a suspended tenant itself, as it reaches incident-service with a service token, which the status filter lets
  through. Alerts `TenantPauseSyncFailing` (runs failing) and `TenantPauseSyncStalled` (no instance completed a
  run in 5 minutes). Audited in both tenants, alerted on every change
  (`PlatformTenantSuspensionChanged`, critical). Every auth-service table holding a tenant's data has a foreign key
  to `tenants` (V31/V32, `ON DELETE RESTRICT`; not the auth email and audit outboxes), so no tenant can have data
  without the row that makes it suspendable; a token naming a tenant with no row (only one minted outside
  auth-service, e.g. `/dev/token`) still gets full access, counted and alerted (`PlatformTenantStatusRowMissing`),
  and its first write in auth-service is answered 403, not 500 (`UnrecordedTenantHandler`). V31 names every tenant
  id it had to record in a warning in auth-service's log. Deactivating a single user now also ends their sessions, and a
  refresh or a personal API key of a deactivated user is refused (until then deactivation only stopped new logins).
- **Audit trail through an outbox** (backlog #0-84, every service with audit events: auth-, incident-,
  notification-, escalation-, postmortem-service): an audit event is a row in the service's own outbox table,
  written in the transaction of the action it records, so a rolled-back action leaves no event, a committed one
  cannot lose it, and a Kafka outage stalls no request. There is no other path: `AuditEventPublisher` exists only
  in a service with an outbox table. A relay (ShedLock, one per service, taken only when a row is due) sends the
  rows in order, at least once; incident-service drops a resent event by its id
  (`audit_events.event_id`, unique per tenant, so one tenant's records cannot pre-empt another's), and treats
  only that and the Kafka-offset key as duplicates. It takes each record's tenant from its payload, which the
  `X-Tenant-Id` header must match (`TenantKafkaRecordResolver`, as every consumer does), and rejects a record
  whose two disagree or whose payload names none; a record it cannot store
  is acknowledged only once its dead-letter copy is in Kafka, and alerts (`AuditEventsRejected`, critical).
  The publisher refuses an event the trail could not store (no tenant, a payload over 256 KiB, a metadata key
  naming a secret) before it is written. A refusal whose transaction rolls back (a
  wrong TOTP) is audited after the rollback. An event about an action that cannot be undone and is already
  committed (a delivered notification, a fired escalation) is written after it; a failure to write one is logged
  and alerts (`AuditEventUnrecorded`, critical) rather than undoing nothing. An error goes into an event cut to
  500 characters on one line, and an unexpected exception by its type only, never its message (`AuditText`): the
  trail is the tenant's to read, and a client library's message can quote a URL with a token or a response body.
  A notification channel's own failure is recorded by the platform's reason (`NotificationFailureReason`, e.g.
  `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_REJECTED`, `SLACK_REJECTED (not_in_channel)`, with at most a checked provider code; also a
  `reason` field of its own in the `NOTIFICATION_FAILED` event), never the mail server's reply or Slack's response,
  which go to the log only (backlog #0-93). The producers fail a send after 5 s
  without Kafka's metadata (`KAFKA_PRODUCER_MAX_BLOCK_MS`) instead of Kafka's default 60 s, except
  escalation-service's, whose escalation event is sent once (#0-4). A backlog older than 10 minutes alerts the
  operator by email (`AuditOutboxBacklog`, critical, read from the table, so a stopped relay shows too).
- **No Kafka record let go unkept** (backlog #0-96): a consumer acknowledges a record only once it is processed or
  its dead-letter copy is acknowledged by Kafka (`DeadLetterPublisher.deadLetterThenAcknowledge`); a failed copy and
  a transient failure (`KafkaFailures`) are `nack`ed and read again, never left unacknowledged, which skipped them.
  A record without `X-Event-Type` is dead-lettered, no longer dropped. ingestion-service answers 503 with
  `Retry-After` when an alert it cannot process cannot be copied either. At least once: a copy can be stored twice,
  identified by its `sourceTopic`, `sourcePartition` and `sourceOffset`. Bounded so that no record can hold a
  partition, every tenant on it, for ever: 5 s per copy (a producer of its own, 2 s metadata block), a poll of
  copies within half of `max.poll.interval.ms` (checked at startup), a record failing past
  `kafka.consumer.redelivery-deadline` (30 min) dead-lettered and alerted (`KafkaRecordRedeliveryGaveUp`,
  critical), a copy's payload cut to 128 KiB. Retries are counted in `kafka.records.redelivery.requested{reason}`
  and alert after 15 minutes without a break (`KafkaRecordRedeliveryStuck`, high). An unexpected exception goes
  into the copy and the log by its type only (a driver's message can quote a row). ingestion-service waits for a
  request's copies together (one 5 s deadline, `max.block.ms` 5 s instead of Kafka's 60 s) and releases the dedup
  keys of alerts a lost copy was to keep; its copies' deadline counts from the wait, and no copy is started after one
  failed. Not bounded: a copy Kafka does not take at all, retried while Kafka is down. Accepted: a database outage
  longer than the redelivery deadline dead-letters the record at each partition's head, about one per partition per
  deadline; an audit event dead-lettered that way is missing from the trail until replayed by hand (#0-97), and
  raises both `AuditEventsRejected` and `KafkaRecordRedeliveryGaveUp`.
- **Structured logs** (backlog #0-94, step 1): every service writes one JSON object per line in Elastic Common
  Schema, to the console and to a log file if one is ever configured. It is Spring Boot's own structured logging,
  set for all seven by `shared`'s `StructuredLoggingDefaults`. Its encoder escapes every value, so a CR/LF from a
  Kafka header, a payload field or a library's exception message stays inside its line; before, each call site had
  to remember not to log a raw value. `tenantId`, `requestId`, `userId` and `kafkaMessageId` are fields of that
  object (the set is pinned by a test). A service whose logs would not be ECS refuses to start
  (`StructuredLoggingGuard`), whatever set the format: its configuration, an environment variable or ConfigMap
  outside this repository, `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON`, a Logback file of its own, or a reshaped JSON object
  (`logging.structured.json.*`: a renamed or excluded `tenantId` would vanish from every line). Only
  `platform.logging.plain-text: true` lets plain text through, for a developer's `spring-boot:run` in the
  gitignored `application-local.yml`; CI fails on that switch, or a Logback file, in any tracked file
  (`check-structured-logging.sh`).
- **Log collection** (backlog #0-94, step 2, docker-compose): Alloy reads every `incident-*` container's output and
  ships it to Loki, kept 15 days (the compactor deletes older lines) and read in Grafana. Alloy reaches the Docker
  API only through `docker-socket-proxy` (GET on containers and networks, every other call refused, on an
  internal network with Alloy alone, pinned by digest), never through the socket, which is root on the host. Loki
  and Alloy answer without authentication, so neither publishes a port and both are on an internal `logs` network
  with only Grafana and Prometheus: no service, kafka-ui or pgAdmin can reach them. Prometheus is the one
  container on both `default` and `logs`: it scrapes Loki and Alloy but proxies neither, so reaching it gives no
  way to their data (it was reachable from `default` before). Loki's delete API is off, so
  nothing can erase lines before the retention does. Grafana, Loki's only reader, is not on the services' network
  either (it would be a way around the `logs` network), listens on `127.0.0.1` only and has an admin password with
  no default. The proxy, Loki and Alloy run read-only, with no capabilities and no privilege gain (Alloy as its
  image's `alloy` user, not root), each under a memory limit. Only the seven services' JSON is parsed, a level
  outside TRACE..ERROR becoming `OTHER`; another container's lines are kept as they are, so Postgres, Kafka and
  pgAdmin output is in Loki too, for 15 days, and can carry tenant values (a Postgres error quoting a row): it is
  read under the same rule as the services' lines, by whoever can log in to Grafana.
  `tenantId`, `requestId`, `userId` and `kafkaMessageId` are structured metadata, not labels, so no value from a
  request adds a stream. Docker keeps at most 3 x 10 MB of each container's log (`x-logging`). A pipeline that
  stops raises `LogPipelineDown`, `LogPipelineRestarting`, `LogPipelineNotScraped`, `LogsNotFlowing`, `LogDiscoveryFailing` or `LogsDropped`; the smoke
  test checks that every service's lines arrive parsed, that the proxy refuses writes, that the pipeline's
  networks are internal and hold exactly the containers they should, and that this hardening is in the compose
  file.
- **Tenant id and Kafka tenant** (backlogs #0-91, #0-92): every tenant id is a slug of 3-63 `[a-z0-9-]`
  (`TenantIds`), enforced by a `CHECK` on every table with a `tenant_id` in every service, when a token is issued and read
  (`JwtUtils`, `JwtAuthFilter`), on the `X-Tenant-Id` header of auth-service's public endpoints (400),
  in `TenantContext.set` and for every Kafka record: so no tenant id can carry a line break into a log line or
  a new series into a metric. A Kafka record's tenant is its payload's; the header is a copy written only by
  `TenantRecords` (no longer by the producer interceptor from the thread's context, which incident events
  depended on). Consumers refuse a record whose payload tenant is invalid or whose header is missing or disagrees, dead-letter
  it under no tenant, count it and alert (`KafkaRecordsTenantRejected`, critical); a record produced without a
  valid header is counted and alerts (`KafkaRecordsWithoutTenant`, high, webhook only). The MDC takes only a valid header
  (`_missing` / `_invalid` otherwise), and no metric is tagged with a value from a record (`kafka.records.received`
  lost its `tenant` tag: a forged, well-formed header could add series without bound). A scheduler or relay
  that reads a row back sets `TenantContext` inside that row's `try`, so a row `TenantContext` refuses fails
  alone instead of ending the batch for every tenant (found in review); the `CHECK` keeps such a row from
  being written at all.
- **API keys** (backlog #0-89): in auth-service a key reaches only the team routes, and only with the scope
  `teams:read` / `teams:write` (the role checks kept); every other route refuses it, so a key cannot invite users,
  change roles, create keys or integrations or change tenant settings (`ApiKeyAccess`, deny by default). A
  password reset, an admin MFA reset and the break-glass reset revoke the user's personal keys; a password change
  does on request (`revokePersonalApiKeys`). Creating a key, an integration's included, emails the account (a
  personal key its owner, a tenant key the admin who created it). Tenant and integration keys outlive their
  creator by design, so every key records who created it and from which session: an admin lists a user's keys
  (`GET /api/v1/api-keys?createdBy=`) and revokes all they created since a time
  (`POST /api/v1/api-keys/revoke-created-by`, or `revokeKeysCreatedSince` on the admin MFA reset; an archive
  records how many it kept). Tenant and integration keys created before V26 have no recorded creator. Every key is
  announced by its own email, showing its id (never merged, so one key cannot hide behind another's notice);
  a user may create at most 20 keys per hour, revoked ones included (429; `api-keys.creation-limit.per-user-per-hour`,
  env `API_KEY_CREATION_LIMIT_PER_USER_PER_HOUR`), which bounds those emails. Outside auth-service only ingestion-service accepts API keys, and only
  tenant keys (backlog #0-16).
- **Service identity**: service tokens carry the tenant as a signed claim and an `aud` naming the one service that
  accepts them; the only tenant-less token is the API-key introspection purpose token, accepted on one route.
- **Tenant isolation**: per request (`TenantContext`), per Kafka record, across async hand-offs and in every query.
- **HTTP**: stateless sessions, CORS allow-list, HSTS, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `nosniff`, Referrer-Policy;
  ingestion payloads capped at 1 MB; Slack requests verified by signature; WebSocket authenticated at `CONNECT`.
- **Actuator**: only `health`, `info` and `prometheus`, on a separate management port, health details only when
  authorized.

### Local stack (docker-compose)

Built for a developer machine, not for a shared host: well-known credentials are expected there (the
`docker/.env.example` values `incident_secret` and `postgres_admin_dev`, and pgAdmin's `admin`). Grafana is the
exception since it reads every tenant's logs (backlog #0-94 step 2): it is published on `127.0.0.1` only, its
admin password (`GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) has no default, and its image is pinned. What it does protect: the monitoring stack's secrets (the operator tenant's Integration API key, the
dead man's switch URL) live in `docker/secrets/`, which is gitignored as a whole and mounted read-only; every email
goes to Mailpit, never to a real address.

### Not done yet

Open items from the audit and earlier, most important first within each area. Each one is described in
[BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md).

- **Kubernetes**
  - Pods run without a `securityContext` and the namespace has no Pod Security Admission label: backlog #0-64.
  - No NetworkPolicy, so every pod reaches every data store and management port: backlog #0-65.
  - The staging and prod overlays are swapped, so "prod" deploys to the staging namespace: backlog #0-29.
  - The Ingress has no TLS: backlog #0-75.
- **Data stores**
  - Redis has no password, Kafka no SASL/ACLs, and nothing uses TLS: backlog #0-66. Until then anyone who
    reaches the broker can produce records: one with a forged tenant is refused and dead-lettered (#0-92), but
    each one also fires the critical `KafkaRecordsTenantRejected` alert and writes a dead-letter record, so the
    alert can be set off on purpose, and a flood fills the dead-letter topic and the logs. The dead-letter
    topics' content is untrusted for the same reason (any field, the tenant and the `X-Tenant-Unresolved`
    marker included, can be forged): nothing reads them today, and a future reader or replayer must resolve
    the tenant again from the original payload, as a consumer does.
  - All seven services share one database role that owns every table, so neither grants nor Row-Level Security
    separate one service's tables from another's, and a SQL injection can plant a trigger, view or function that
    runs as a superuser if a superuser touches a service table, even under `SET ROLE`: backlog #0-67.
  - At the HPAs' maximum replicas during a rolling update, the services' connection pools exceed what Postgres
    allows them: backlog #0-79.
- **GitHub and CI**
  - No static analysis has ever run: Snyk Code is not enabled and CodeQL is not set up: backlog #0-68.
  - The Snyk dependency scan is red on every run, so a new finding changes nothing, and the Tomcat ignores in `.snyk`
    rest on a false "all endpoints require JWT" claim: backlog #0-69.
  - No status check is required before merging to `main`: backlog #0-2.
  - Any Marketplace action is allowed to run (`allowed_actions: all`): backlog #0-62.
  - kubeconform is installed unpinned from `releases/latest`: backlog #0-76.
- **Container images**
  - Built images are not scanned and no SBOM is produced: backlog #0-70.
  - Mutable image tags in k8s and compose, and k8s third-party images not tracked by Renovate: backlog #0-71.
- **Application**
  - Swagger UI and the OpenAPI documents are public in every profile: backlog #0-73.
  - Whether `/dev/token` should also need an explicit switch besides the dev profile is open: backlog #0-77.
  - A suspended tenant's work that came due before a service could see the suspension (its status cache, up to
    10 s) has already gone; the pause covers everything after. The end of a pause is when the sync sees the
    resumption (up to about 20 s late), which lengthens a stopped escalation timer by as much: backlog #0-82. The sync
    asks auth-service once per tenant with waiting work, in every pausing service, every 10 s, and a long-paused
    tenant's backlog is re-read on each poll: fine now, a limit at thousands of tenants: backlog #0-102.
  - While auth-service is down, a service that has never had an answer for a tenant (after its own restart: every
    tenant) runs that tenant's background work, even if it is suspended in full: the per-row check fails open like
    the filter, and the sync records nothing it was not told (counted `tenant.pause.unconfirmed`, alerted
    `TenantStatusLookupFailing`); a tenant it knew to be paused stays paused: backlog #0-82.
  - A Slack ACK refused for suspension (a path with no button until #0-35) would be counted (`slack.ack.refused`)
    but the Slack user not told; like the status filter it fails open for a tenant never answered for while
    auth-service is down: backlog #0-82.
  - Outside auth-service a suspension takes up to 10 s (the status cache; the pause of its background work, up to
    about 20 s, is below), and during an auth-service outage a
    service gives full access to a tenant it never had a status for, e.g. every tenant after its own restart
    (fail-open by decision, alerted `TenantStatusLookupFailing`); a tenant resumed during the outage stays refused
    there until auth-service answers: backlog #0-82.
  - The bound on sign-ins refused for suspension (a few per user, then 429 without an audit event) lives in Redis
    and fails open like the other Redis limits: while Redis is down every refusal is audited, so a user replaying a
    refused invite or reset link can grow the tenant's audit trail; parallel refusals can also overshoot the bound a
    little (not atomic). Accepted: backlog #0-82.
  - A suspended tenant's live WebSocket session on an instance that has not cached its status yet stays open until
    the next sweeps (up to about 20 s); STOMP never waits on auth-service: backlog #0-82.
  - A tenant cannot be offboarded: its data stays in all seven services until someone edits the databases:
    backlog #0-101.
  - Operator MFA enrolment is not bound to the invite: an owner who misses the 24 h "MFA enabled" email, or whose
    mailbox the password thief also controls, does not stop the thief's factor: backlog #0-87.
  - Logs are collected only in docker-compose; Kubernetes has no log collection, and no Prometheus, Alertmanager
    or Grafana either: backlog #0-106. Nothing alerts on what a line says, nor on one service (or all seven) going
    silent: `LogsNotFlowing` fires only when no line at all arrives, and the proxy's own lines keep it quiet
    (#0-107). Whoever can log in to Grafana
    reads every tenant's lines (there is no access per tenant; locally Grafana is on `127.0.0.1` with a password of
    the developer's own); whoever controls Alloy can read every container's environment (secrets included) and
    files (archive, export) through the
    socket proxy, which cannot narrow `/containers` further (#0-94 step 2). One tenant's lines cannot be deleted
    before the 15 days are up (one Loki org, no tenant label): offboarding, #0-101. No trace id links one operation's
    lines across services (#0-94 step 3). Since step 1 they are JSON with
    every value escaped, so a value from outside can no longer split or forge a line; a service would refuse to
    start otherwise, unless a deployment outside this repository sets `PLATFORM_LOGGING_PLAINTEXT` on purpose
    (logged as a warning at every start). auth-service's break-glass command logs JSON too.
    An exception's message still reaches the log as the library wrote it (`error.message`,
    `error.stack_trace`): escaped, not filtered.
  - The MFA recovery of a customer tenant's only admin (#0-90) verifies the person by procedure only: the platform
    holds no contact of the tenant independent of the admin's own mailbox, and checks no DNS record itself:
    backlog #0-98. Whoever holds the admin's mailbox can cancel every such recovery, and whoever holds the
    admin's session can add a second admin, after which the platform keeps out; both page the operator and
    are left to a person (accepted; the operator's lever is suspending the tenant in full, #0-82).
  - The public token endpoints (`reset-password`, `accept-invite`, `mfa-recovery/cancel`) have no request limit:
    a token is 32 random bytes, single-use, so guessing is out of reach, but an unauthenticated flood still costs a
    lookup and a log line each: backlog #0-99.
  - A tenant id with data in other services but no data in auth-service can be provisioned, and its admin would
    see that data; the operator guide says to check first: backlog #0-85.
- **Project**
  - No `SECURITY.md`, no private vulnerability reporting, no Dependabot alerts: backlog #0-74.
- **Local stack**
  - A jar built on a developer's machine (`./mvnw package`) contains their gitignored `application-local.yml`
    with real local secrets; images and CI-built jars do not: backlog #0-100.
  - Every port docker-compose publishes, except Grafana's (on `127.0.0.1` only; Loki, Alloy and the socket proxy
    publish none), is on all interfaces, Postgres included, where the admin is a
    superuser with the password from `docker/.env` (the template's is a known dev value): backlog #0-72. That
    includes Prometheus, unauthenticated with `--web.enable-lifecycle` (anyone can make it reload or quit); since
    #0-94 step 2 it is also on the `logs` network, where it only scrapes, so it must not get the admin API or a
    remote-write or federation path that would carry what it reaches there.

## Observability

### Metrics — Micrometer + Prometheus + Grafana

All services expose metrics via `/actuator/prometheus` on the management port (8091–8097), and the bundled `docker/prometheus.yml` has one scrape job per service — including auth-service on 8097. Prometheus scrapes every 15 seconds. Grafana dashboards cover:

- HTTP request rate and error rate per service
- JVM heap, non-heap memory, GC activity
- Rate limit rejections per tenant and per IP
- Kafka consumer lag per consumer group (via `kafka-exporter` — `KafkaConsumerLagHigh` and `KafkaConsumerLagCritical` alert rules)

Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana and `kafka-exporter` are included in `docker-compose.yml`. See [Running Locally](#running-locally) for startup order — the monitoring stack requires a pre-generated Alertmanager token.

### Distributed Tracing Context

Every log line is one JSON object in Elastic Common Schema (backlog #0-94), with the MDC context as fields:

```json
{"@timestamp":"2026-10-08T09:17:32.411Z","log":{"level":"INFO","logger":"com.incidentplatform.incident.service.IncidentCommandService"},"service":{"name":"incident-service"},"message":"Incident created: id=3f669983","tenantId":"test-tenant","requestId":"e87b7a28-...","userId":"11111111-...","ecs":{"version":"8.11"}}
```

Filter by field (`tenantId`, `requestId`, `userId`, `kafkaMessageId`, `service.name`, `log.level`) in any log store that reads JSON (Loki, ELK, CloudWatch). `requestId` is per service for now; a trace id that follows one operation across services is #0-94's step 3. Locally, `spring-boot:run` can print plain text instead (README "Step 2").

### Logs — Alloy + Loki + Grafana

In docker-compose, Alloy collects the output of every container named `incident-*` and sends it to Loki (backlog #0-94, step 2), where it is kept for 15 days. To read the logs, open Grafana → Explore → **Loki**:

```logql
{service="incident-service"}                            # one service (the compose service name)
{service=~".+-service", level="ERROR"}                  # every platform service's errors
{service=~".+-service"} | tenantId="acme"               # one tenant's lines (structured metadata)
{service=~".+-service"} | requestId="e87b7a28-..."      # one request
{service="notification-service"} | json | message=~"(?i).*slack.*"
```

`tenantId` and the other identifiers are what the line says, not authenticated facts: a service's own log lines are trustworthy because they go through the platform's encoder, but anything a service writes raw to stdout (a library's println) could carry a `tenantId` of its own. Treat them as a search aid, not as evidence of which tenant did what; that is the audit log's job.

The labels are `service`, `container` and `level` (only the seven services' lines are parsed for a level). `tenantId`, `requestId`, `userId` and `kafkaMessageId` are structured metadata, so a filter on them follows `|`. Lines that are not JSON (Postgres, Kafka, Redis) are kept as they are. A service started with `spring-boot:run` is not a container, so its lines stay in its terminal. Alloy reads the Docker API through `docker-socket-proxy`, which permits only GET on containers and networks. Loki and Alloy publish no port and are on an internal `logs` network with only Grafana and Prometheus; Loki's delete API is off. Prometheus scrapes both, for the `LogPipelineDown`, `LogPipelineRestarting`, `LogPipelineNotScraped`, `LogsNotFlowing`, `LogDiscoveryFailing` and `LogsDropped` alerts.

### Management Port Isolation

Health and metrics endpoints run on a dedicated port per service, never mixed with the business API:

| Service | API Port | Management Port |
|---|---|---|
| auth-service | 8087 | 8097 |
| ingestion-service | 8081 | 8091 |
| incident-service | 8082 | 8092 |
| notification-service | 8083 | 8093 |
| escalation-service | 8084 | 8094 |
| postmortem-service | 8085 | 8095 |
| oncall-service | 8086 | 8096 |

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions pipeline runs on every push and pull request to `main`.

### Job 1 — Build, Test & Coverage

Runs on every push and every PR:

```
Checkout → Java 21 setup (Temurin) → Compile → Run tests with JaCoCo → Upload coverage reports → (PR) coverage summary → (PR) changed-lines coverage gate
```

- Compiles all 7 modules and runs the full test suite
- JaCoCo coverage reports uploaded as artifacts (retained 14 days)
- Coverage gate in the build: **60%** line coverage per module (`jacoco:check`)
- On pull requests: at least **60%** of the changed Java lines must be covered (`diff-cover`); the uncovered lines are listed in the job summary
- On pull requests: JaCoCo per-file coverage breakdown in the job summary (informational)

### Job 2 — Detect Changes

A path filter (`dorny/paths-filter`) decides what the expensive downstream jobs must do:

- **`services`** — which service images need building. A change under one service's directory rebuilds only that service; a change to `shared/**`, `service-parent/**` or the root `pom.xml` rebuilds all 7, and every push to `main` builds all 7 as a safety net.
- **`infra`** — whether anything changed that could break the compose stack (`docker/**`, Dockerfiles, `k8s/**`, `application*.yml`, the root `pom.xml` and each service's `pom.xml`).

### Job 3 — Build Docker Images

Runs after Jobs 1 and 2 whenever the computed `services` list is non-empty (on pull requests as well as on pushes to `main`):

```
Build Docker image (dynamic matrix: only the changed services, up to all 7) → GitHub Actions cache (layer reuse)
```

- Matrix strategy with `fail-fast: false` — one failure doesn't cancel others
- Uses `docker/build-push-action` with GitHub Actions cache for fast layer reuse
- Images are validated but not pushed (`push: false`) — no registry configured yet (next step: GitHub Container Registry)

### Job 4 — Validate Kubernetes Manifests

Always runs. Renders `k8s/base` and the `dev`, `staging` and `prod` overlays with `kubectl kustomize` and validates each rendered output with `kubeconform -strict` against the real Kubernetes API schemas. It also cross-checks that every service directory with a `Dockerfile` has a matching Deployment in the rendered base.

### Job 5 — Docker Compose Smoke Test

Boots PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, the log pipeline (docker-socket-proxy, Loki, Alloy) and all 7 services with `docker compose up`, curls each service's health endpoint, checks the services' DB role, and checks that every service's lines reach Loki parsed (`.github/scripts/test-log-collection.sh`, backlog #0-94). Runs on every push to `main`, and on pull requests when `infra` changed or any service directory changed.

### Security Scanning

Two dedicated workflows run independently from the main CI pipeline — security scans are slow
(NVD database download takes 2–15 minutes) and should not block every feature build.

**OWASP Dependency-Check** (`.github/workflows/owasp-dependency-check.yml`):

```
Checkout → Java 21 setup → Run dependency-check:aggregate → Upload HTML report as artifact
```

- Compares all Maven dependencies against the NVD CVE database
- Fails the build when any dependency has a CVSS score >= 7.0 (High or Critical)
- HTML report uploaded as artifact (retained 30 days) — downloadable from the Actions run
- Runs every Monday at 08:00 and on every `pom.xml` change merged to `main`
- Known CVEs that cannot be fixed (false positives or awaiting upstream release) are
  documented in `owasp-suppressions.xml` with a verdict, justification, and expiry date

**Snyk** (`.github/workflows/snyk.yml`):

```
Job A: Dependency scan → SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab
Job B: Code scan (SAST) → SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab (not running, backlog #0-68)
```

- **Dependency scan**: scans `pom.xml` against Snyk vulnerability database — adds fix
  suggestions and exploit maturity data on top of OWASP
- **Code scan (SAST)**: static analysis of Java source code for security issues —
  SQL injection, XXE, path traversal, insecure deserialization, hardcoded secrets
  — **not running yet**: every run ends in `403 Snyk Code is not enabled`, hidden by
  `continue-on-error`, so no SAST result has ever been produced (backlog #0-68)
- Results visible in **Security → Code scanning alerts** in GitHub without opening CI logs
- Dependency scan failures fail the workflow, but it is red on every run today, so a new finding changes
  nothing (backlog #0-69), and no check is required to merge (backlog #0-2); SAST findings are reported as
  alerts only (manual review required before enforcing)
- Unfixable CVEs documented in `.snyk` with reason and expiry date
- The CLI is a pinned standalone binary, checksum-verified before it runs, and the token reaches
  only the scan step (backlog #0-61, see [Infrastructure Hardening](#infrastructure-hardening))

Required GitHub secrets: `SNYK_TOKEN`, `NVD_API_KEY` (optional — speeds NVD download from ~15 min to ~2 min).

### Dependency Updates — Renovate

Renovate Bot monitors `pom.xml`, Dockerfiles and GitHub Actions workflows and opens pull
requests automatically when newer versions are available.

Key configuration (`renovate.json`):

- **Schedule**: every weekend — avoids noise during the work week
- **`minimumReleaseAge: 3 days`**: skips releases yanked within 72 hours
- **Spring Framework / Spring Boot**: grouped into one PR, 7-day delay — gives time for
  community reports before updating a core dependency
- **Google Cloud SDK**: 14-day delay — large SDK, higher risk on major updates
- **Vulnerability alerts**: when a CVE is published for any dependency, Renovate opens
  a PR immediately regardless of schedule
- **Major updates**: always labelled `major-update`, never auto-merged
- **GitHub Actions** (`helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests`): keeps every `uses:` pinned to a commit SHA
  and updates the SHA and its `# vX.Y.Z` comment together; all action updates are grouped into one
  PR (backlog #0-60)

Setup: install the Renovate GitHub App at https://github.com/apps/renovate and authorize
it for this repository. Renovate will open a "Configure Renovate" PR to confirm the setup.

---

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Docker Desktop (minimum 4GB RAM allocated)
- `jq` — command-line JSON formatter (`brew install jq` on macOS)

### Step 1 — Start infrastructure

docker-compose needs `docker/.env`: `DB_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are
required, and compose refuses to start without them. The template's database values are for development only;
Grafana's is empty on purpose (it reads every tenant's logs, backlog #0-94), so set your own, at least 16
characters (`make dev-up` warns about a shorter one; compose itself refuses only an empty one).

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env      # once; Option B in Step 4 fills in the rest
openssl rand -base64 24                 # paste the output into docker/.env as GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<output>
                                        # (.env files do not run $(...): pasted as is, the text would be the password)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres redis kafka kafka-ui pgadmin
```

Wait until all containers are healthy:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
```

Expected — all show `(healthy)` or `Up`:
```
incident-kafka      Up (healthy)
incident-postgres   Up (healthy)
incident-redis      Up (healthy)
```

On its first start (empty `postgres_data` volume), Postgres creates two roles: `postgres`, the superuser, for
administration only, and `incident_app`, the role every service connects as, which is not a superuser. Their
passwords come from `POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `DB_PASSWORD` in `docker/.env`. A volume created before backlog
#0-78 still has a superuser `incident_app`, and its `docker/.env` has `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, which `DB_PASSWORD`
replaced. To migrate it while keeping its data, or to start over, see
[docs/database-roles.md](docs/database-roles.md). Services run with `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (Option A) don't read
`docker/.env`; they need `spring.datasource.password` in `application-local.yml` (Step 2) or an exported
`DB_PASSWORD`, as `application.yml` has no default (backlog #0-66).

### Step 2 — Create application-local.yml for each service

Each service requires `src/main/resources/application-local.yml` — this file is excluded from git (contains secrets).

> **Important**: Use only standard ASCII hyphens (`-`) in YAML comments, not em dashes (`—`). Em dashes are multi-byte UTF-8 characters that prevent Spring Boot from loading the file.

**Create this file in all 7 services:**

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: local-development-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long-absolutely-not-for-production-use-only

logging:
  structured:
    format:
      console: ""   # plain text locally; every deployment logs JSON (ECS), backlog #0-94
  level:
    com.incidentplatform: DEBUG

platform:
  logging:
    plain-text: true   # without it the service refuses to start with plain-text logs
```

**The six services that use the database** (all but ingestion-service) also need its password: there is
no default in `application.yml` (backlog #0-66). Use the same value as `DB_PASSWORD` in `docker/.env`.
If the file already has a `spring:` key (notification-service's mail settings), put `datasource:` under it
instead of adding a second `spring:`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    password: incident_secret   # = DB_PASSWORD in docker/.env
```

If a service stops at startup with `password authentication failed for user "incident_app"`, the password
is missing or wrong. Spring Boot does not report a missing value as such here, see
[docs/database-roles.md](docs/database-roles.md#a-missing-or-wrong-password).

**auth-service** additionally requires two encryption keys — one for MFA secrets, one for tenants' Slack bot tokens (separate on purpose, so one leaked key does not expose both; backlog #0-21). Each is 32 bytes, base64 (`openssl rand -base64 32`):

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: local-development-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long-absolutely-not-for-production-use-only

mfa:
  encryption-key: dGVzdC1rZXktMzItYnl0ZXMtZm9yLWRldi1vbmx5ISE=

slack:
  encryption-key: bG9jYWwtc2xhY2sta2V5LWRldi1vbmx5LTMyYnl0ZSE=

logging:
  structured:
    format:
      console: ""   # plain text locally; every deployment logs JSON (ECS), backlog #0-94
  level:
    com.incidentplatform: DEBUG

platform:
  logging:
    plain-text: true   # without it the service refuses to start with plain-text logs
```

**incident-service** additionally needs WebSocket allowed origins:

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: local-development-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long-absolutely-not-for-production-use-only

websocket:
  allowed-origins:
    - http://localhost:4200
    - http://localhost:3000

logging:
  structured:
    format:
      console: ""   # plain text locally; every deployment logs JSON (ECS), backlog #0-94
  level:
    com.incidentplatform: DEBUG

platform:
  logging:
    plain-text: true   # without it the service refuses to start with plain-text logs
```

**postmortem-service** additionally needs a Gemini API key:

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: local-development-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long-absolutely-not-for-production-use-only

gemini:
  api-key: your-gemini-api-key-here

logging:
  structured:
    format:
      console: ""   # plain text locally; every deployment logs JSON (ECS), backlog #0-94
  level:
    com.incidentplatform: DEBUG

platform:
  logging:
    plain-text: true   # without it the service refuses to start with plain-text logs
```

Every service but auth-service reads from auth-service: each tenant's status (all six, backlog #0-82) and, in **notification-service**, each tenant's Slack workspace. `auth-service.base-url` defaults to `http://localhost:8087`, so nothing is needed locally unless auth-service runs elsewhere; then set it (or `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`) in every one of them:

```yaml
auth-service:
  base-url: http://localhost:8087
```

> The JWT secret must be at least 64 characters. The value above meets this requirement — copy it exactly.

### Step 3 — Build all modules

```bash
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

### Step 4 — Start all services

#### Option A — Maven (development, hot reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — auth-service (users, teams, API keys, MFA)
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl auth-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local

# Terminal 2
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl ingestion-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local

# Terminal 3
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl incident-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local

# Terminal 4
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl notification-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local

# Terminal 5
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl escalation-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local

# Terminal 6
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl postmortem-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local

# Terminal 7
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl oncall-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

#### Option B — Docker Compose (all services in containers)

```bash
cd docker
cp -n .env.example .env   # if Step 1 has not created it yet
# Edit .env — fill in JWT_SECRET, MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY and SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY
# (DB_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD already have dev values;
# GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD is the one you set in Step 1):
#   JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)
#   MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
#   SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)   # a different value
docker compose up -d
```

> **auth-service** requires `MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — two different
> 32-byte base64 AES-256-GCM keys, for TOTP secrets and tenants' Slack bot tokens at rest. See `docker/.env.example` for all required variables.

> **Customer tenants**: no account and no customer tenant is seeded. A platform operator creates each one: accept
> the operator admin's invite and log in (Step 5, steps 2-3), enable MFA for that account and log in again with a
> code (the platform API requires a session that completed MFA; commands in the guide), then
> `POST /api/v1/platform/tenants` with
> `{"tenantId": "acme", "displayName": "Acme Corp", "adminEmail": "..."}`. The tenant's first admin gets an
> invite in Mailpit (http://localhost:8025) and accepts it with `POST /api/v1/auth/accept-invite`. Details:
> [docs/tenant-provisioning.md](docs/tenant-provisioning.md).

### Step 5 — (Optional) Start monitoring stack

The monitoring stack (Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, kafka-exporter, the log pipeline
(docker-socket-proxy, Loki, Alloy), plus Mailpit and a heartbeat sink) watches the platform itself. Alertmanager sends the platform's own alerts three
ways (backlog #0-16, `docker/alertmanager.yml`):

- **Watchdog** (always firing) → a dead man's switch URL about every 2 minutes (the route sets
  1 minute, but Alertmanager only repeats on a `group_interval` tick after `repeat_interval` has
  passed, so in practice every other tick). Locally the `heartbeat-sink` container logs it; in a
  real deployment use a healthchecks.io / Dead Man's Snitch / Grafana IRM heartbeat, which pages
  when the pings stop — give it a period and grace time comfortably above 2 minutes (e.g. 5 min).
- **Critical platform alerts** → email to the operator (Mailpit locally), out of band, so they
  still arrive when ingestion-service, Kafka or notification-service is the thing that broke.
- **Everything** → ingestion-service, as incidents of the reserved `platform-operator` tenant.
  Alertmanager authenticates with that tenant's Integration API key, like any tenant's
  Alertmanager does.

Invite and password reset emails of every tenant ride out an SMTP outage (backlog #0-52). A request
only queues the email; auth-service creates the token when it sends it (only its hash is stored), so
the link is valid for its full lifetime — 7 days for an invite, 15 minutes for a reset — from the moment
it goes out. A failed send is retried after 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 2 h and then every 6 h
(`INVITE_EMAIL_RETRY_BACKOFF`) until the request's own deadline (the same 7 days / 15 minutes after it was
made). When sends keep failing for 30 minutes with none succeeding, `AuthEmailDeliveryFailing` (critical)
fires; each email given up is reported by `AuthEmailPermanentlyFailed` (high) — resend the invite, or have
the user request a new reset. The same outbox sends the "two-factor authentication was enabled/disabled"
notices (backlog #0-83), the "an administrator reset your MFA" notice (#0-88) and one "API key created"
notice per key (#0-89): no token, no link, retried for at least 24 h (as long as the platform API's grace
period). An MFA_ENABLED notice that was never sent keeps that factor out of the platform API.

One-time setup (needs the services from Step 4 running). auth-service invites the operator
tenant's first admin about 30 s after startup when `OPERATOR_ADMIN_EMAIL` is set (`docker/.env` for
Option B, `platform.operator.bootstrap.admin-email` in auth-service's `application-local.yml` for
Option A). It then checks every hour until that admin has accepted, and sends a fresh invite if the
email permanently failed (e.g. SMTP was down) or the 7-day invite expired, so a lost invite needs
no restart and no database edit (backlog #0-49). While no admin can log in, auth-service reports
`platform_operator_admin_pending = 1` and `OperatorAdminNotActivated` fires after an hour. If the
tenant's users need a human (the log says so: e.g. `OPERATOR_ADMIN_EMAIL` was changed after the
first invite went to another address, which was never accepted), auth-service does not create a
second admin or delete anyone; remove the unaccepted user and the next check invites the
configured address:

```bash
# 1. Dead man's switch URL (local stand-in)
cp docker/deadmans-switch-url.example docker/secrets/deadmans-switch-url

# 2. Accept the operator admin's invite: open Mailpit (http://localhost:8025), copy the token from
#    the invite email, then set a password
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8087/api/v1/auth/accept-invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token": "<invite token>", "password": "<password>"}'

# 3. Log in to the operator tenant
OP_LOGIN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8087/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: platform-operator" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "ops@incident-platform.local", "password": "<password>"}')
OP_TOKEN=$(echo "$OP_LOGIN" | jq -r .accessToken)
OP_USER_ID=$(echo "$OP_LOGIN" | jq -r .userId)

# 4. Create the integration; its API key is shown once — store it as Alertmanager's secret
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8087/api/v1/integrations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OP_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "platform-alertmanager", "source": "prometheus"}' \
  | jq -r .apiKey | tr -d '\n' > docker/secrets/platform-operator-api-key

# 5. Put the operator admin on call (PRIMARY) for the operator tenant — see below
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8086/api/v1/oncall/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OP_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg u "$OP_USER_ID" '{userId: $u, userName: "Platform operator",
        email: "ops@incident-platform.local", role: "PRIMARY",
        startsAt: (now|todate), endsAt: ((now + 365*86400)|todate)}')"
```

Step 5 matters because the `platform-operator` tenant is an ordinary tenant for notifications:
an incident's content goes only to that tenant's on-call PRIMARY (backlog #0-18; the platform's
alerts carry no team, so the tenant-wide PRIMARY is used). Without an on-call entry every platform
incident is marked `UNDELIVERABLE`, and the operator only gets a content-free
"[PLATFORM] Notification undeliverable (NO_ONCALL)" email instead of the incident. The critical
alerts' direct email from Alertmanager does not depend on this. Renew or replace the entry before
`endsAt`, and in a real deployment schedule a rotation instead of one long entry.

Then start the monitoring stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d alertmanager prometheus grafana kafka-exporter \
  docker-socket-proxy loki alloy
```

| Tool | URL | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | — |
| Alertmanager | http://localhost:9093 | — |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | admin / `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| Mailpit (operator email, invites) | http://localhost:8025 | — |
| Heartbeat sink | `docker logs incident-heartbeat-sink` | — |
| Logs (Loki) | Grafana → Explore → Loki (no port of its own) | admin / `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |

> Grafana's admin password is applied only when its `grafana_data` volume is first created. A volume from
> before backlog #0-94 step 2 still has `admin`: change it with
> `docker exec incident-grafana grafana cli admin reset-admin-password '<the value of GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD in docker/.env>'`.

> The monitoring stack is optional for local development — all 7 services run and process
> alerts without it.
>
> The key does not expire. To rotate it, create a new integration, overwrite
> `docker/secrets/platform-operator-api-key` (Alertmanager reads the file on every request, no
> restart), then delete the old integration. ingestion-service caches a key's validity for at most
> 60 s, so a revoked key stops working within a minute. If auth-service is down, ingest answers
> `503` + `Retry-After` and Alertmanager retries; a wrong or revoked key gets `401`, which it does
> not retry. A key of a tenant suspended read-only gets `503` + `Retry-After: 300` +
> `TENANT_READ_ONLY` (paused), one of a tenant suspended in full `403` + `TENANT_SUSPENDED`
> (backlog #0-82).

### Step 6 — Verify all services are up

```bash
for port in 8091 8092 8093 8094 8095 8096 8097; do
  echo -n "Port $port: "
  curl -s http://localhost:$port/actuator/health | jq -r .status
done
```

Expected:
```
Port 8091: UP
Port 8092: UP
Port 8093: UP
Port 8094: UP
Port 8095: UP
Port 8096: UP
Port 8097: UP
```

### Infrastructure URLs

| Tool | URL | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| Kafka UI | http://localhost:8090 | — |
| pgAdmin | http://localhost:5050 | admin@incident.com / admin |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | — |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 (this machine only) | admin / `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` |

---

## Running on Kubernetes

> **Monitoring stack note**: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, kafka-exporter and the log
> pipeline (Loki, Alloy) are part of the `docker-compose.yml` setup only — they are not deployed
> in Kubernetes (backlog #0-106).
> In a production Kubernetes environment, monitoring is typically handled by a separate
> stack (e.g. `kube-prometheus-stack` via Helm), configured with the same routes as
> `docker/alertmanager.yml` and a `platform-operator` Integration API key as a Secret.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (minimum 6GB RAM allocated)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- `jq`

### Step 1 — Start Minikube

```bash
minikube start --cpus=4 --driver=docker
```

Verify the cluster is ready:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
# Expected: minikube   Ready   control-plane
```

### Step 2 — Point Docker to Minikube's daemon

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

> Run this in every terminal where you build images. It affects only the current shell session.

### Step 3 — Build all Docker images

```bash
for service in auth-service ingestion-service incident-service notification-service escalation-service postmortem-service oncall-service; do
  echo "Building $service..."
  docker build -t $service:dev -f $service/Dockerfile .
done
```

First run takes 20–40 minutes — Maven downloads all dependencies. Subsequent builds are fast due to Docker layer cache.

Verify:
```bash
docker images | grep ":dev"
# Expected: 7 images listed
```

### Step 4 — Configure secrets

`k8s/overlays/dev/secrets.yml` contains base64-encoded values. The file ships with
placeholders — replace them with your own values before deploying.

**Required for basic operation** (incidents, escalation, audit log):

```bash
# JWT_SECRET — must be at least 64 characters
echo -n "local-development-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long-not-for-production-k8s" | base64
```

**Required for AI postmortems** (postmortem-service):

```bash
# Get a free key at https://aistudio.google.com/
echo -n "your-gemini-api-key" | base64
```

**Required for Slack notifications** (notification-service):

```bash
# Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
# Bot Token Scopes needed: chat:write, im:write
# The bot token is NOT a platform secret any more (backlog #0-21): each tenant
# admin installs their own via POST /api/v1/slack-workspace. Only the App's
# signing secret is platform-wide.
echo -n "your-slack-signing-secret" | base64
```

Replace the `data` values in `k8s/overlays/dev/secrets.yml` with your encoded output:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secrets
  namespace: incident-platform-dev
type: Opaque
data:
  JWT_SECRET: <base64-encoded-value>
  MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY: <base64-encoded-value>    # auth-service — 32-byte AES-256-GCM key (the dev overlay ships a ready-made one)
  GEMINI_API_KEY: <base64-encoded-value>        # optional — postmortems disabled if missing
  SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY: <base64-encoded-value>  # auth-service — 32-byte AES-256-GCM key for tenants' Slack bot tokens, different from MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
  SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET: <base64-encoded-value>  # optional — Slack notifications disabled if missing
  DB_PASSWORD: <base64-encoded-value>           # password of incident_app, the services' DB role (backlog #0-78)
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: postgresql-admin                        # the postgres superuser, for administration only
  namespace: incident-platform-dev
type: Opaque
data:
  username: <base64-encoded-value>              # postgres
  password: <base64-encoded-value>
```

Both database passwords are applied only when the PostgreSQL volume is first created. See
[docs/database-roles.md](docs/database-roles.md), including how to migrate a volume created before backlog #0-78.

> **Minimum setup**: only `JWT_SECRET` needs replacing to run the full incident lifecycle
> (ingestion → incident → escalation → audit log). Slack and Gemini are optional — the
> platform works without them, notifications fall back to logs.

### Step 5 — Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev
```

### Step 6 — Wait for all pods to be ready

```bash
kubectl get pods -n incident-platform-dev -w
```

Wait until all pods show `1/1 Running`. Init containers wait for PostgreSQL and Kafka — typically 2–5 minutes on first deploy. Press `Ctrl+C` when done.

Expected:
```
auth-service-xxx           1/1   Running   ...
escalation-service-xxx     1/1   Running   ...
incident-service-xxx       1/1   Running   ...
ingestion-service-xxx      1/1   Running   ...
kafka-0                    1/1   Running   ...
notification-service-xxx   1/1   Running   ...
oncall-service-xxx         1/1   Running   ...
postgresql-0               1/1   Running   ...
postmortem-service-xxx     1/1   Running   ...
redis-xxx                  1/1   Running   ...
```

### Step 7 — Configure local DNS

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 incident-platform.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Step 8 — Start Minikube tunnel (keep this terminal open)

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

### Step 9 — Verify the cluster is reachable

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://incident-platform.local/api/v1/incidents
# Expected: 403  (reachable — authentication required)
```

### Kubernetes Configuration Highlights

The `k8s/` directory uses **Kustomize** with environment overlays:

```
k8s/
├── base/               # Environment-agnostic manifests (Deployments, Services, HPA, Ingress)
└── overlays/
    ├── dev/            # Minikube: 1 replica, 768Mi memory limit, relaxed probe delays
    ├── staging/
    └── prod/
```

Key features of the base configuration:

- **Rolling updates** — `maxUnavailable: 0`, `maxSurge: 1` — zero downtime deployments
- **Init containers** — each service waits for PostgreSQL and Kafka before starting
- **Health probes** — readiness and liveness on the management port (never the API port)
- **HorizontalPodAutoscaler** — CPU 70% and memory 80% targets; 1–3 replicas for auth, ingestion and incident-service, 1–2 for notification, escalation, postmortem and oncall-service
- **ShedLock** — prevents duplicate scheduled job execution across replicas

---

## End-to-End Test

These steps work for both local and Kubernetes deployments. Replace the base URL as needed:
- **Local**: `http://localhost:808X`
- **Kubernetes**: `http://incident-platform.local`

### Step 1 — Generate a dev token

**Local:**
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8082/dev/token?tenantId=test-tenant" | jq -r .token)
echo "Token: ${TOKEN:0:50}..."
```

**Kubernetes** (dev overlay only: `/dev/token` exists only where the dev profile is set, backlog #0-63, and is intentionally not exposed via Ingress). Use port-forward to incident-service:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/incident-service 8082:8082 -n incident-platform-dev &
sleep 2
TOKEN=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8082/dev/token?tenantId=test-tenant" | jq -r .token)
echo "Token: ${TOKEN:0:50}..."
```

### Step 2 — Send a firing alert (simulating Prometheus/Alertmanager)

**Local:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/alerts/prometheus \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "alerts": [{
      "status": "firing",
      "labels": {
        "alertname": "HighCPU",
        "severity": "critical",
        "instance": "server-01"
      },
      "annotations": {
        "summary": "CPU usage above 90%",
        "description": "Server server-01 CPU is at 95%"
      }
    }]
  }' | jq .
```

**Kubernetes:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://incident-platform.local/api/v1/alerts/prometheus \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "alerts": [{
      "status": "firing",
      "labels": {
        "alertname": "HighCPU",
        "severity": "critical",
        "instance": "server-01"
      },
      "annotations": {
        "summary": "CPU usage above 90%",
        "description": "Server server-01 CPU is at 95%"
      }
    }]
  }' | jq .
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "received": 1,
  "processed": 1,
  "duplicates": 0,
  "fullySuccessful": true
}
```

### Step 3 — Verify the incident was created

**Local:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8082/api/v1/incidents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.content[]'
```

**Kubernetes** — the Ingress JWT_SECRET differs from the local secret. Generate a token via port-forward to get one signed by the cluster:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/incident-service 8082:8082 -n incident-platform-dev &
sleep 2
TOKEN_K8S=$(curl -s "http://localhost:8082/dev/token?tenantId=test-tenant" | jq -r .token)

curl -s http://incident-platform.local/api/v1/incidents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_K8S" | jq '.content[]'
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "id": "<incident-id>",
  "tenantId": "test-tenant",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "title": "CPU usage above 90%",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "allowedTransitions": ["ACKNOWLEDGED"]
}
```

### Step 4 — Acknowledge the incident

```bash
INCIDENT_ID="<id from previous response>"

curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:8082/api/v1/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "ACKNOWLEDGED"}' | jq .
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "status": "ACKNOWLEDGED",
  "acknowledgedAt": "...",
  "mttaMinutes": 0,
  "allowedTransitions": ["RESOLVED"]
}
```

### Step 5 — Resolve the incident

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:8082/api/v1/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "RESOLVED"}' | jq .
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "status": "RESOLVED",
  "resolvedAt": "...",
  "mttaMinutes": 0,
  "mttrMinutes": 1,
  "allowedTransitions": ["CLOSED"]
}
```

After resolving, `postmortem-service` automatically calls the Gemini API and generates a draft. Retrieve it with:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8085/api/v1/postmortems/incident/$INCIDENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .
```

### Step 6 — Check the audit log

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8082/api/v1/incidents/$INCIDENT_ID/audit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.[]'
```

Shows the full chronological timeline of every event across all services for this incident — created, acknowledged, resolved, notifications sent, postmortem generated.

### Step 7 — (Optional) Register an on-call schedule

For notifications and escalations to reach the right person:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8086/api/v1/oncall/schedules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "userName": "Jan Kowalski",
    "email": "jan@example.com",
    "slackUserId": "U0123456789",
    "role": "PRIMARY",
    "startsAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "endsAt": "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }' | jq .
```

## Makefile commands

```bash
make dev-up          # Start the whole docker-compose stack (infra, monitoring, log pipeline, services); needs the three passwords in docker/.env
make dev-down        # Stop all containers
make dev-reset       # Stop + remove volumes (clean database)
make grafana-password-check # Warn if GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD is under 16 characters, or Grafana still accepts admin/admin (a volume from before it); runs at the end of dev-up
make build           # Build all modules (skip tests)
make test            # Run all tests
make run-ingestion   # Start ingestion-service locally (profile=local)
make run-incident    # Start incident-service locally
make run-escalation  # Start escalation-service locally
make run-notification # Start notification-service locally
make run-postmortem  # Start postmortem-service locally
```

There is no `make` target for auth-service or oncall-service — start those with
`./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl auth-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local` (or `oncall-service`).

## Running Tests

```bash
# All modules

# Single module
./mvnw test -pl incident-service
./mvnw test -pl auth-service
```

### Test Coverage Highlights

| Test class | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `IncidentFsmTest` | 25 parameterized cases — all allowed and forbidden state transitions |
| `IncidentCommandServiceTest` | Deduplication, severity escalation, optimistic lock, FSM validation; the escalation level recorded in a transaction of its own (backlog #0-96) |
| `IncidentEscalationLevelIntegrationTest` (incident-service, Postgres) | `recordEscalationLevel` commits before it returns, a REST change committed between its read and commit is thrown from the call, another tenant's incident is untouched (backlog #0-96) |
| `AlertIngestionServiceTest` (ingestion-service) | Dead-letter copies awaited together from the wait, none started after a failed one, the payload copied once, dedup keys released when a copy is not stored and kept when it is (backlog #0-96) |
| `AlertIngestionControllerSecurityTest` (ingestion-service) | Roles per endpoint; 503 with `Retry-After: 10` and `INGESTION_UNAVAILABLE` when a dead-letter copy is not stored (backlog #0-96) |
| `IncidentQueryServiceTest` | Filter routing (Specification vs simple query), tenant scoping |
| `IncidentKafkaConsumerTest` | Per-record tenant isolation, TenantContext cleanup in `finally`, no cross-tenant leaks; a failure handed to `DeadLetterPublisher`, never acknowledged by the consumer itself (backlog #0-96) |
| `NotificationServiceTest` | Orchestration, fault isolation between channels, idempotency; a failed send recorded and counted by its reason, never the provider's text (backlog #0-93) |
| `NotificationExceptionTest`, `EmailNotificationChannelTest`, `SlackNotificationChannelSendTest`, `SlackApiClientTest` (notification-service) | A failure's text built from its reason and a checked provider code only; mail failures classified from the shapes JavaMail produces (authentication, rejected or malformed address, connection, timeout, 4xx deferral); Slack's `ok:false` a failure with its code on both `chat.postMessage` and `chat.update`, a refused token apart (`SLACK_AUTH_FAILED`), an unreadable answer and HTTP statuses classified on the send path too, nothing of the body kept; a refused broadcast does not stop the on-call DM; a malformed address or a refusal counted as the tenant's only when it is the recipient's (backlog #0-93) |
| `NotificationRouterTest` | Routing for all 5 event types, escalation-target lookup with PRIMARY fallback, UNDELIVERABLE when nobody is on call or no channel has an address, skipped channels |
| `SlackApiClientResilienceTest` (notification-service) | Through Spring's proxy, from `SlackNotificationChannel.send()`: with `application.yml`'s own retry and breaker settings, the circuit breaker opened by 5xx and by timeouts, then failing at once without calling Slack (the ACK update too), never opened by a 401, a 429 or an `ok:false`, closed by a successful trial call and reopened by a failed one (backlog #0-104); a 5xx and a read timeout retried (3 attempts), then `SLACK_UNAVAILABLE` from the fallback; a body trickling in past the read timeout cut too; a redirect not followed (the request carries the bot token); a 401 and an `ok:false` not retried; the ACK update retried too (backlog #0-103: the send path used to bypass the proxy) |
| `NotificationChannelPropertiesTest` | Operator alert address validation, `min-interval` default and rejection of zero or negative values; the Slack timeouts' defaults and rejection of zero or negative ones (backlog #0-103) |
| `SlackResilienceConfigTest` (notification-service) | `application.yml`'s `slack` breaker, built by Resilience4j's auto-configuration: counts only network errors and 5xx and ignores what a tenant's workspace answers (4xx, 429, `ok:false`), its time-based window, threshold and open state, no health indicator; the retry does not retry an open breaker (backlog #0-104) |
| `NotificationSchedulerDefaultsTest` (notification-service) | `application.yml`'s processing budget, Slack timeouts and Slack retry (as Resilience4j's auto-configuration builds it from the file) together fit the scheduler's 4-minute lock, so the shipped defaults start (backlog #0-103) |
| `StructuredLoggingDefaultsTest`, `StructuredLoggingGuardTest` (shared) | Every service's logs on a real `SpringApplication`: ECS fields and the pinned MDC key set, a CR/LF from outside kept inside one line (message, argument, MDC value, exception), the log file in ECS too; a start refused for a format set in `application.yml`, by an argument, through `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` or by a Logback file of its own (each reason on its own in the guard test); plain text only with `platform.logging.plain-text` (backlog #0-94) |
| `AuditOutboxTest` (shared, Postgres) | Audit outbox SQL: written in the caller's transaction, due order of its index, the lock-free due check, batch mark-sent, retry by the database's clock, purge in chunks up to a cap, table name checked by the constructor (backlog #0-84) |
| `AuditOutboxRelayTest` (shared) | Relay: no lock without a due row, pipelined batches, per-row tenant, Kafka failures pause it while a refused record does not, mark failures logged, scrape-time gauges, capped purge, settings incl. the 45-character table name (backlog #0-84) |
| `AuditOutboxConfigurationTest` (shared) | `audit.outbox.table` turns the outbox and the publisher on (events to the table); without it there is no publisher, and a service injecting one does not start; it wires with Spring Boot's own Kafka and Jackson beans; a bad table name stops the startup (backlog #0-84) |
| `UnrecordedAuditEventsTest` (shared) | `audit.event.unrecorded` registered at zero for every declared event type, so `AuditEventUnrecorded` sees the first failure (backlog #0-84) |
| `AuditOutboxPersistenceIntegrationTest` (notification-, escalation-, postmortem-service, Postgres) | The service's outbox migration takes the shared SQL and joins the JPA transaction; through the real service: the `notification_log` row, the level-2 escalation task, the postmortem's FAILED mark each commit or roll back with its audit event, under the action's tenant (backlog #0-84) |
| `AuditTextTest` (shared) | Error text for an audit event: cut to 500 characters on one line (control characters and U+2028/U+2029 too), never inside a surrogate pair; an unexpected exception by its type only (backlog #0-84) |
| `TenantIdsTest`, `TenantRecordsTest` (shared) | The one tenant id format (slug), refused without quoting the value; every tenant record built with its header (backlog #0-91/#0-92) |
| `TenantKafkaRecordResolverTest` (shared) | A record's tenant is its payload's; a header must match it; missing, invalid and mismatched tenants refused, counted (registered at zero) and never quoted (backlog #0-92); `trustedTenantOrNull` neither throws nor counts (backlog #0-96) |
| `TenantKafkaProducerInterceptorTest` (shared) | The interceptor writes no header any more: it counts records without a valid one, except a dead-letter record marked as tenant-less (`TenantRecords.withoutTenant`); the topic name alone exempts nothing (backlog #0-91) |
| `TenantKafkaConsumerInterceptorTest`, `TenantKafkaRecordInterceptorTest` (shared) | Validation only on the poll thread (nothing dropped or rewritten); the MDC takes only a valid header (`_missing` / `_invalid` otherwise) and no metric is tagged with a record's value (backlog #0-92) |
| Tenant-id CHECK guard (every service's Postgres integration test) | Every table with a `tenant_id` carries the slug `CHECK`; a new table without one fails (backlog #0-92) |
| Tenant foreign-key guard (`AuthRepositoryIntegrationTest`), `TenantForeignKeysMigrationTest`, `UnrecordedTenantHandlerTest` (auth-service) | Every auth-service table with a tenant's data has a validated foreign key to `tenants`, named in `UnrecordedTenantHandler`; V31 records each orphaned id (one per table seeded) and names it in a warning, its keys already refuse a new orphan before V32 validates them, and a tenants row with data cannot be deleted; a write refused by one of them is 403, any other integrity error the shared 500 (backlog #0-82) |
| `PausedTenantsTest` (shared, Postgres) | The paused-tenants SQL: a new pause starting at the suspension's time from auth-service, an unchanged one and a change of mode that keeps its start; full access and a bad tenant id refused; a resumption commits the service's hook with the row's deletion or rolls both back (backlog #0-82) |
| `PausedTenantsSyncTest`, `TenantWorkGuardTest`, `PausedTenantsConfigurationTest` (shared) | Pause sync: paused tenants and tenants with work asked together in id order, each once, a cut-short run continued by the next (paused tenants rotate too); `tenant.pause.sync.runs` counts completed runs only; only auth-service's own answer pauses or resumes (`confirmedStateOf`), so an outage changes nothing; one tenant's failure isolated; budget and lock; the per-row check uses `accessOf` (re-asked when expired or never cached), not `knownAccessOf`, and a batch's tenants are prefetched in parallel, at most 8 at a time, waiting at most its limit and never failing the run; the pause takes auth-service's suspension time; a `tenant-pause.table` other than the service's query table stops startup; `tenant-pause.table` without a `PausableWork` fails startup (backlog #0-82) |
| `TenantStatusProviderTest`, `AuthServiceTenantStatusProviderTest` (shared) | `confirmedStateOf`: auth-service's answer with its suspension time (`since`, ISO-8601 on the wire, left out for full access), the last one kept through an outage, and empty (not the fail-open FULL) for a tenant never answered for (backlog #0-82) |
| `SlackActionServiceTest` (notification-service) | The ACK path (no button until #0-35) of a suspended tenant (read-only or full) is refused before any lookup, counted (`slack.ack.refused`, registered at zero); an active tenant's goes to incident-service; an invalid tenant id in the button value is ignored (backlog #0-82); an unexpected exception from one channel's update fails only that channel, the others are still updated (backlog #0-93) |
| `EscalationPauseIntegrationTest`, `NotificationPauseIntegrationTest`, `PostmortemPauseIntegrationTest` (Postgres) | Each scheduler query leaves a paused tenant out, even its oldest rows under a batch of one; the candidates; escalation timers moved on by the pause to the second (running at the suspension, started during it, due after it but before a late sync paused the tenant, due before it; never moved earlier), notification lookup windows restarted; the sync end to end in the JPA transaction (backlog #0-82) |
| Scheduler and relay batches (`IncidentEventOutboxSchedulerTest`, `NotificationSchedulerTest`, `EscalationSchedulerTest`, `PostmortemRetrySchedulerTest`, `AuthEmailSchedulerTest`, `AuditOutboxRelayTest`) | A row whose tenant id `TenantContext` refuses fails alone; the next row is processed (backlog #0-92) |
| `DeadLetterPublisherTest` (shared) | `publishAndWait` returns only once Kafka has the dead-letter copy; a failure, a timeout or a send that throws at once is thrown (backlog #0-84); a record carries a valid tenant in its header or none, and its reason on one line (backlog #0-91/#0-92); a consumed record is acknowledged only after its copy is stored, nacked when it is not (stack trace logged once); a transient failure nacked without a copy and dead-lettered after its deadline; an unexpected exception recorded by type only; payloads cut on a character boundary; copies awaited under one deadline; the poll-interval budget; the dead-letter template's short metadata block (backlog #0-96) |
| `DeadLetterPublisherKafkaIntegrationTest` (shared, Kafka) | On a real broker in `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE`: a record left unacknowledged is skipped by the next acknowledgement and never comes back (a sentinel record shows it, no clock wait); a nacked one does; `DeadLetterPublisher` retries a transient failure and dead-letters a poison pill before acknowledging (backlog #0-96) |
| `RecordRedeliveriesTest` (shared) | Since when the record at a partition's head has been failing, per consumer group; another offset replaces it; a settled record is forgotten (backlog #0-96) |
| `KafkaFailuresTest` (shared) | A database outage in every type Spring gives it (incl. `DataAccessResourceFailureException`, `CannotCreateTransactionException`) is transient, at any cause depth; a record's own fault is not (backlog #0-96); `reason` keeps a content-free platform message and names any other exception by type and place, never its message |
| `AuditPersistenceIntegrationTest` (incident-service, Postgres) | V12–V14: event-id dedup per tenant, the consumer's constraint names, the CONCURRENTLY index valid, the outbox joining the JPA transaction (backlog #0-84) |
| `AuditEventTypesTest` (shared) | Audit event type values equal their names, are unique and fit the column; `NOTIFICATION_UNDELIVERABLE` is distinct from `NOTIFICATION_FAILED` |
| `OperatorAlertServiceTest` | Content-free operator email, per tenant and reason rate limit, no email when unconfigured, a send failure never fails the caller |
| `IncidentEventConsumerTest` (notification-service) | Tenant from the payload, header required and equal (backlog #0-92), TenantContext lifecycle, escalation level/target parsing, dead-lettering of invalid levels; a database outage nacked, an unexpected exception dead-lettered, a record without `X-Event-Type` dead-lettered (backlog #0-96) |
| `NotificationEscalationSchemaIntegrationTest` | V5/V6 migrations, `ddl-auto: validate`, tenant- and level-aware unique index and CHECK constraints, UNDELIVERABLE status and the first-lookup-failure column (Testcontainers, needs Docker) |
| `EscalationServiceTest` | Level 1/2 scheduling, ACK cancellation, idempotency, severity timeouts |
| `EscalationSchedulerTest` | Timer logic, level 2 scheduling after level 1, fault isolation (a task with an invalid tenant id fails alone, backlog #0-92); a suspended tenant's task held back untouched, the batch's tenants prefetched first, within the processing budget, a processing budget that stops a run before its ShedLock ends, refused at startup when too long (backlog #0-82) |
| `IncidentEventConsumerTest` (escalation-service) | Per-record tenant isolation, sequential records without leaks, a record without `X-Tenant-Id` dead-lettered (backlog #0-92); a database outage nacked, not dead-lettered; a record without `X-Event-Type` dead-lettered (backlog #0-96) |
| `PostmortemServiceTest` | Generation, Gemini failure handling, CRUD, audit event publishing |
| `PostmortemRetrySchedulerTest` | Retry logic for FAILED postmortems, max retry limit; what a failure records: a fixed text for Gemini, the type for anything else, never a message (backlog #0-84); a suspended tenant's postmortems held back on both paths, each batch's tenants prefetched first, within a processing budget per run, refused at startup when longer than its lock (backlog #0-82) |
| `AuditEventConsumerTest` (incident-service) | Audit events stored per record's tenant; duplicates by event id or offset; unstorable records dead-lettered, counted (counters registered at zero) and acknowledged only once Kafka has the copy (backlog #0-84); a failed save nacked when transient, rejected as `unexpected` otherwise (backlog #0-96) |
| `IncidentEventConsumerTest` (postmortem-service) | Tenant from the payload, header required and equal (a missing or mismatched header is dead-lettered), ignored event types; a database outage nacked, not dead-lettered; a record without `X-Event-Type` dead-lettered (backlog #0-96) |
| `JwtUtilsTest` | Token generation, validation, expiry, secret length validation; no token issued for a tenant id that is not a slug (backlog #0-92) |
| `TenantContextTest` | ThreadLocal isolation between threads, TenantAwareTaskDecorator propagation; an invalid tenant id refused before it reaches the MDC (backlog #0-92) |
| `OncallScheduleServiceTest` | Schedule creation, overlap detection, current on-call resolution |

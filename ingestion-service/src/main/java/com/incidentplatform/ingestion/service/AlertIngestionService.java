     * Ingests an alert payload from an external monitoring system.
     *
     * <p>Changed (backlog #0-96): an alert that cannot be processed is copied
     * to the dead-letter topic and this method waits until Kafka has the copy.
     * It used to send it and move on, so a failed send lost the alert with
     * only an ERROR line, while the sender was told it was handled. Now the
     * request fails instead ({@link DeadLetterNotStoredException}, a 503 with
     * {@code Retry-After}) and the sender retries the whole payload: alerts
     * of the same payload already sent are then caught by deduplication, and
     * a dead-letter copy whose acknowledgement was lost may be stored twice
     * (at-least-once). Resolved notifications of the payload are sent again;
     * incident-service's auto-resolve is a no-op for an incident already
     * resolved.
     *
     * <p>Found in review: the copies of one request are started together and
     * awaited together, under one {@link DeadLetterPublisher#DEAD_LETTER_TIMEOUT}
     * (they used to be awaited one by one, each up to the producer's 60 s
     * metadata block); a payload whose alerts fail to serialize is copied once,
     * not once per alert; and when a copy is not stored, the dedup keys of the
     * alerts it was to keep are released, or the sender's retry would be
     * answered as a duplicate and the alert lost after all.
     *
     * @param teamId  resolved from the Integration ApiKey via
     *                {@code ApiKeyLookupServiceImpl.resolveTeamId()}.
     *                Null when authenticated with JWT or Integration has no team.
     *                Propagated to every {@link com.incidentplatform.shared.dto.UnifiedAlertDto}
     *                so incident-service can set {@code Incident.team_id}.
     * @throws DeadLetterNotStoredException if an alert that could not be
     *         processed could not be copied to the dead-letter topic either

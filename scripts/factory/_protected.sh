# The paths no agent writes, read from their one definition, .ai/rules/protected-paths.md. Sourced, not
# run; no side effects. Used by changed-paths.sh (a diff touching them needs the owner) and by next-item.sh
# and check-queue.sh (an item whose Touches names one is not autopilot work). Portable: awk + sed.
#
#   protected_paths <protected|build-config> [ref]   the entries of one list, one per line, from the commit
#                                                    <ref> (the base), or the working tree without one
#   paths_regex <anchored|free>   < paths            an ERE for those paths: anchored matches a repository
#                                                    path (a directory: what is under it; a file: itself),
#                                                    free matches them anywhere in a text, a directory
#                                                    also without its slash (".github", "scripts/factory");
#                                                    a bare alternation, so jq's scan returns the match
# Every ERE metacharacter of an entry is escaped, so an entry is always a literal path.
#
# Fixed (backlog #0-122): the list was copied into each script and agent and had drifted apart.

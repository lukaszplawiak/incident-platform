# Outbound firewall of the factory's devcontainer: default deny, then an allow-list. Modelled on the
# reference devcontainer of Claude Code (github.com/anthropics/claude-code, .devcontainer/), adapted to
# this project. Run as root at container start (postStartCommand). Needs NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW.
#
# IPv4 only: every allowed service is reached over IPv4, so IPv6 allows loopback and nothing else (without
# this, a container with an IPv6 route would bypass the whole allow-list). If the container has IPv6 and
# ip6tables cannot be set, the script fails rather than leave IPv6 open.
# Allowed: DNS to the container's own resolver only (no direct queries to outside resolvers); the
# Anthropic API and login; GitHub (its published IP ranges); Maven Central; the Docker host (Testcontainers'
# mapped ports, and Ollama on the host for the optional local model); extra hosts given as arguments (the
# ntfy server, when notifications are on). Everything else from this container is rejected.
#
# Not covered, by design of this setup: the host's Docker daemon is reachable (Testcontainers), and a
# container it starts has the host's network, not this firewall. Data can also leave through DNS queries
# the resolver forwards, and through the allowed hosts themselves (a push to GitHub, a PR body). The
# firewall narrows exfiltration; it does not make it impossible (docs/ai-factory.md, "What isolates what").
# Domains are resolved once, at start: a CDN that moves IPs needs a container restart.
#
# Usage: init-firewall.sh [extra-host ...]
# ============================================================

# Fail closed: if anything below fails, the container ends with every policy DROP (no network at all,
# which is noticed at once) instead of the default ACCEPT. Before this trap, a domain that did not resolve
# (statsig.anthropic.com, 2026-10-09) ended the script before the DROP policies, and the container ran
# with an open network while only the missing "Firewall up" line said so.
# Limits: a trap does not run when the script is killed with SIGKILL (the policies stay ACCEPT, and
# "Firewall up" is missing, as above); IPv6 is closed when the container has it at start, and an interface
# that gains IPv6 later is not covered until the container restarts.

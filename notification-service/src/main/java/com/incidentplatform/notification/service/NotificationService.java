/**
 * Notification application service — two distinct responsibilities:
 *
 * <h2>1. Enqueue (called by Kafka consumer — fast path)</h2>
 * {@link #enqueue} writes a PENDING outbox entry to {@code notification_queue}
 * and returns immediately. The Kafka consumer acknowledges after this returns.
 * No HTTP calls, no external dependencies — just one DB INSERT. Still
 * {@code @Transactional} — a single fast operation with no external I/O
 * is exactly what that annotation is for; unlike {@link #processEntry}
 * below, there's nothing here to fix.
 *
 * <h2>2. Process (called by scheduler — slow path)</h2>
 * {@link #processEntry} reads a PENDING entry, resolves the current oncall
 * recipient via HTTP, sends notifications through each channel (Slack, Email,
 * SMS), and writes to the immutable {@code notification_log} audit trail.
 * This runs in a dedicated scheduled thread, completely decoupled from Kafka.
 *
 * <h2>Why recipient is resolved at process time, not enqueue time</h2>
 * The oncall schedule may rotate between enqueue and processing (typically
 * 30 seconds). Resolving at process time ensures the notification reaches
 * whoever is currently on duty — not the person who was on duty when the
 * Kafka event arrived.
 *
 * <h2>Fixed (backlog #42): {@code processEntry} no longer wraps external
 * I/O in an open transaction</h2>
 * See {@link NotificationPersistenceService}'s Javadoc for the full
 * account — {@code processEntry} previously carried {@code @Transactional}
 * on the whole method, including the oncall-service HTTP lookup and every
 * per-channel send (Slack/SMTP/SMS). Every database write below now goes
 * through {@code NotificationPersistenceService} instead, each in its own
 * short, independent transaction opened only after the corresponding
 * external call has already completed — matching the same fix already
 * applied to {@code EscalationScheduler} (backlog #39).

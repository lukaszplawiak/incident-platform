# ADR-0055: The factory moves to three zones, a GitHub queue and a ruleset merge, one stage at a time

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Backlog:** stage 0 of this migration (the freeze below); each later stage gets its own item when its turn comes
- **Date:** 2026-11-13
- **Author:** human (owner's decisions of 2026-11-13, drafted in an interactive session)
- **Reversible:** yes, stage by stage — every stage names its rollback, and one that needs more than a switch or a
  `git revert` is split

## Context

The factory runs as one Claude Code session in a devcontainer on the owner's Mac. Its boundary is text: hooks that
match the commands an agent writes (`guard-protected-bash.sh`, `readonly-bash.sh`, `write-scope.sh`,
`factory-ops-bash.sh`) and a `dontAsk` allow list. Each hardening item showed the same limit: #0-235 needed four review
rounds, each finding another spelling past the match (`git add -f`, an edited `.gitignore`, `.//.ai`,
`--output=.ai/runs//LOCK`, a quoted subcommand), and #0-236 records that the run state sits in the working tree every
allowed git command acts on. Code run through `./mvnw` reaches everything (#0-116), and the owner approves every PR.

The owner wants an autonomous factory with a human only where the risk is (high-risk lanes, intent, rules, a sample
after merge). Companies that publish how they do this (Stripe's devboxes, Ramp's sandboxes, Anthropic's Claude Code
sandbox) isolate each task in a fresh environment and keep credentials out of it; Claude Code's own documentation calls
argument-constraining Bash rules fragile and the sandbox the stronger layer.

## Decision

**Target.**
- **Three zones, cut by trust and credentials, not by agent count.** The owner's Mac (the owner, a Backlog Creator,
  `/human-review` in a read-only fresh clone); a build VM, the only place where code an agent wrote runs (a dispatcher
  script holds the builder's credential; the implementer works in a fresh devcontainer per task with no GitHub
  credential); a review VM without Docker or Maven (panel, verifier, acceptance; it reads CI's artifacts, never the
  build VM's local gate).
- **Identities.** The owner; `bc-app`, `builder-app` and `review-app`, three GitHub Apps (short-lived installation
  tokens bound to the repository; the builder is an App, not the `lukaszplawiakbot` PAT); GitHub's ruleset is the only
  one that merges (required checks pinned to their app, `factory/review` from review-app, CODEOWNERS and
  `factory/human-gate` on the high-risk lane). No agent approves or merges. **No status the ruleset requires is set
  with builder-app's credential:** `factory/lane`, `factory-trace` and `factory/human-gate` come from GitHub Actions, and
  `factory/review` from review-app, each pinned to its app in the ruleset. builder-app's credential sits on the build
  VM, where agent-written code runs with Docker (root), so a status it could set is one an escaped test could set on its
  own PR (security review of this ADR, round 1).
- **Dispatchers are scripts, not agents.** They choose work, claim and lease, start and remove containers, check the
  result, push, open the PR and set statuses; agents plan, write code and review, and hold no token. One dispatcher per
  zone, so a claim needs no compare-and-swap (a local `flock`).
- **The queue is GitHub Issues + one Project**: `Feature` issues hold a brief, `Task` sub-issues are the work, native
  blocked-by dependencies, fields for status, risk, complexity and lease. `BACKLOG.md` and `BACKLOG-DONE.md` freeze as an
  archive once the queue moves.
- **The audit record stays in the repository.** Escape markers (`**Fixes:**` / `**Escaped from:**`), decision history and
  the owner's audit decisions stay in files changed only by the owner's PRs (ADRs, `.ai/audit/`): an issue's text can be
  edited by apps and leaves no history git keeps, so issues hold work state only (#0-129, #0-126 stay the model).
- **Local first, portable from the first VM**: the VM is provisioned as code (cloud-init, which Lima and a cloud provider
  both read); the task image is built in CI and pulled from GHCR; dispatchers read their configuration from the
  environment only and keep no state of their own (it is in GitHub); logs and transcripts leave the machine. The move to
  a cloud VM, where the provider's firewall sits outside the VM, is its own stage.

**Stages**, each tested on real items of the application before the next starts; an item is created for a stage when
its turn comes:

| # | Stage | Exit | Rollback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Freeze hook hardening (below) | this ADR merged and set to Accepted by the owner | revert the statuses |
| 1 | Organisation and repository transfer; `repository-settings.rb check` | one item merged the usual way | transfer back |
| 2 | Build VM (provisioned as code) running today's devcontainer | 3 items with no environment problem | the devcontainer on the Mac |
| 3 | Baseline metrics: agent calls, stage times, model, transcripts kept (#0-204, #0-205); a seed pattern for a removed positive control (PR #572; the next free id after #0-218's P-25 and P-26) | numbers for 3 items | revert |
| 4 | Dispatcher v0: the container has no token; push, PR and commit trailers by the dispatcher (#0-212); builder-app | 3 PRs opened by it | `shipBy: shipper` |
| 5 | review-app and the review VM, in shadow, then required | a `/seed-bugs` series on the new path catches at least what the old one did | drop the required check |
| 6a | `factory/lane`, `factory-trace`, `factory/human-gate`, CODEOWNERS (#0-153), `/human-review`; not required at first | lane agrees with the owner on 3 PRs | not required |
| 6b | Deterministic gates one at a time (#0-108 ArchUnit, Squawk, commitlint, TODO); each removes its rule from the prompts | each catches its seeded case | revert that gate |
| 7 | Issues + Project, all open items at once; dispatcher v1 reads the Project | 3 items taken, claimed and closed | export, switch back to the frozen file |
| 8 | Backlog Creator and features (sub-issues, flags), on a technical feature | one feature Done | tasks written by hand |
| 6c | Hook cleanup (after 8): boundary hooks removed; quality hooks (`guard-tests`, `guard-migrations`) become required CI checks first | a seeded series still caught | revert |
| H | Holdout: two jobs (image built without secrets, scenarios run with them), the service's logs never go back to the implementer | a feature's holdout green | not required |
| 9 | Private repository on GitHub Team; CI minutes measured first; no merge queue on Team private | a red check blocks a merge | public again, only before briefs reach issues |
| C | Build and review VMs to the cloud; heartbeat (dead man's switch), cost and token budgets | a week unattended | the local VMs |
| 10 | Auto-merge on the low-risk lane, 10–20% sampled after merge, migration switches removed | 9 of 10 PRs as the owner judges them | required approvals = 1 |

**Rules of the migration.** One factory change at a time, then 2–3 application items; the old path stays behind a
switch until the new one has passed; a review or security stage exits on a measure with known answers (`/seed-bugs`), not
on two panels agreeing; at least two application items for each factory item, counted by `audit-data.sh`.

**Stage 0, the freeze.** Open items that harden what a later stage removes wait as `Blocked` (superseded by the stage
named): #0-236 (4), #0-225 (2 and 4), #0-211 (6c), #0-210 (6c), #0-214 (6c), #0-217 (4), #0-183 (5), #0-167 (6a),
#0-226 (4), #0-228 (4), #0-234 (4), #0-227 (6a), #0-213 (4), #0-201 (7).
Items a stage carries out point at it: #0-116 (2, then C), #0-202 (2), #0-204 and #0-205 (3), #0-212 (4), #0-153 (6a).
The rest stay as they are; the `/seed-bugs` items (#0-171, #0-190, #0-218, #0-219) are wanted before stage 5.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keep hardening the hooks**: each round of #0-235 found another spelling; a text match cannot bound `./mvnw`, and every
  hour spent there is removed by stage 6c.
- **One VM for the implementer and the reviewer**: the implementer needs Docker for Testcontainers, and Docker is root on
  that VM, so test code could read the reviewer's key.
- **A repository, or a persistent VM, per agent**: forks to synchronise by hand, and state that piles up between runs;
  one repository with a fresh clone per task does neither.
- **An agent that approves and merges**: it adds a credential that can merge and no judgement the reviewer did not make.
- **The builder as the `lukaszplawiakbot` account**: a long-lived PAT on the build VM and a paid seat once private; an
  App's installation tokens expire within the hour. The App's private key, which mints them, does not expire and is
  revoked by hand, so it is the long-lived secret: stage 4 decides where it lives (outside the task containers) and how
  it rotates (an App holds up to 25 keys, so a new one can be added before the old is deleted). Costs: `repository-settings.rb`, the ruleset's actors and `audit-data.sh` (the bot's
  login) change in stage 4.
- **Audit markers in issues, counted by actor**: possible (as `human:*` labels are), but an issue body has no history git
  keeps, and the pipeline audit would read two sources.
- **The cloud first**: no second move and a stronger firewall, but cost, unattended Claude authentication and secrets in
  the first VM stage at once.

## Consequences

- New factory work is checked against this plan: an item that hardens a mechanism a stage removes is frozen, not done.
- The known gaps stay open, and named, until their stage: `./mvnw` (#0-116, stages 2 and C), git's route to the state
  (#0-236, stage 4), the owner's session (#0-167, stage 6a). The frozen gaps (#0-236, #0-167, #0-225) are acceptable
  only while every PR needs the owner's approval: stage 10 (auto-merge) does not start until the stage that closes each
  of them has passed its exit (security review of this ADR, round 2).
- Open, to decide at their stage: how Claude Code authenticates unattended on a VM (an API key or a subscription token,
  within the terms of use); the VM tool on the Mac (Lima, UTM or OrbStack); the high-risk path list in CODEOWNERS; the
  sample rate; Sysbox in the build VM.
- Earlier decisions each stage supersedes or amends, in that stage's own ADR: ADR-0052 (the preflight's bot identity,
  `FACTORY_BOT_LOGIN`) and ADR-0034 (the ruleset's actors and bypass) at stage 4, when builder-app replaces the bot;
  ADR-0053 (factory-ops' one call) at stage 4, when the dispatcher replaces factory-ops; ADR-0054 (the allow list's
  closed list, `git_runtime_unsafe`) and ADR-0050 (the agents' command lists) at stage 6c.
- A reviewer recognises a violation as a stage started before its predecessor's exit, a stage without a rollback, a
  credential inside a task container, a status the ruleset requires set by builder-app, or an audit marker written
  outside the repository.

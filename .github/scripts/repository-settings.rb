# ============================================================
# The GitHub settings that guard `main`, kept in this repository (backlog #0-113, ADR-0034).
#
# Until #0-113 they lived only in GitHub's UI, invisible in any diff: one ruleset forbade deleting and
# force-pushing `main`, and nothing required a pull request, a green check or the owner's review, so the
# autopilot's machine account (Write) could push to `main` directly and `gh pr merge --auto` would merge at
# once. The settings are now files under .github/repository-settings/ (an owner-only path, CODEOWNERS):
#
#   rulesets/<name>.json   one repository ruleset each, the request body of GitHub's rulesets API
#                          (name, target, enforcement, conditions, bypass_actors, rules), every
#                          parameter written out, `bypass_actors` too when it is empty
#   environments/<name>.json  one deployment environment each (backlog #0-154, ADR-0035): who may bypass it, its
#                          deployment branch policy and the branches it allows, its protection rules, and the
#                          names of the secrets it holds (never their values: apply writes no secret)
#   repository.json        `settings`: repository settings (`delete_branch_on_merge`, `allow_auto_merge`);
#                          `admins`: the logins with the admin role, the only ones the ruleset's bypass (the
#                          admin role) reaches, so a new admin would bypass it too; `repository_secrets`: the
#                          repository-level secrets allowed (none: one of them reaches a run on any branch)
#
# and this script is the one way between them and GitHub:
#
#   check   (CI: lint-workflows, every pull request and push to main) fails when GitHub's settings and the
#           files differ, in either direction: a ruleset or a parameter changed, added or removed in the UI
#           and not in a file, or a file not applied. Also fails, before asking GitHub anything, on a
#           required check that no job of a workflow running on every pull request to main reports (a
#           renamed job would leave every pull request waiting forever) and on one without its app's
#           `integration_id` (then a status anyone with Write sets through the statuses API satisfies it), and
#           on a required check that is the name of more than one job in any workflow (a run of the other, a
#           push or a manual dispatch on the pull request's branch, reports a check of that name on the same
#           commit), and the other way, on a job of a workflow running on every pull request that no ruleset
#           requires (a red one would not stop a merge, and a required job that needs it reports "skipped",
#           which passes), and on a workflow or job whose token may write checks or statuses (its run could
#           report a required check in the name of GitHub Actions) or that declares none at all (its token is then
#           the repository default, set in the UI); and on a job that reads a secret (`secrets.<NAME>`, other than
#           GITHUB_TOKEN) outside an environment whose file names that secret, or a workflow that gives one to
#           every job (`env:` at the top, `secrets: inherit`). With --main <commit> (CI, on a pull request: main, fetched) it reads the files from that
#           commit, unless the checked-out commit changes them against its first parent (on a pull request,
#           GitHub's merge commit, whose first parent is main): so applying another pull request's change
#           does not leave every open pull request comparing GitHub with its own older copy (review of #0-113).
#   plan    prints what `apply` would change, and changes nothing.
#   apply   makes GitHub match the files: creates and updates the rulesets first and deletes the ones no
#           file names last, so `main` is never without its rules in between; then the repository
#           settings; then `check`, which must pass.
#
# What `check` cannot see with CI's token: a ruleset's `bypass_actors` (GitHub shows them only to an admin,
# so an actor added in the UI goes unnoticed in CI), the repository settings (not in the read-only
# repository response), the admins (the collaborators list needs more than read), and which secrets exist,
# in the repository and in each environment. `apply` creates and updates environments but never deletes one
# (its secrets would go with it), and never writes a secret: those are the owner's, in Settings. It says so in its
# summary; run by the owner (an admin token), it compares all three, and `plan`/`apply` refuse to run
# without them. `apply` never changes who is an admin: that is the owner's decision, in Settings. Arrays
# are compared as sets (their order means nothing to GitHub). A parameter GitHub adds later fails `check`
# until it is written in its file.
#
# Usage: ruby repository-settings.rb check|plan|apply [--repo <owner/name>] [--root <repository root>]
#        [--main <commit>] (check only)
# (repo: $GITHUB_REPOSITORY, else `gh repo view`). Needs gh with a token (GH_TOKEN in CI); apply needs the
# owner's (admin). Portable to Ruby 2.6.

# ============================================================
# Every hook entry of the factory blocks the call when its hook fails (backlog #0-162 PR 2, ADR-0039).
#
# Claude Code runs a call after a hook that exits other than 0 or 2, one that cannot start (missing, not
# executable) and one that times out: a non-blocking error. The scripts already turn every failure they can see
# into exit 2 (#0-162 PR 1, the fail-closed table of .claude/hooks/test-hooks.sh); a hook that never starts sees
# nothing, and only Claude Code's `"onFailure": "block"` on the entry stops the call then (v2.1.295 or later; an
# older version ignores the field without a word, spike of 2026-10-25, so preflight.sh refuses one). This checks,
# in .claude/settings.json, .claude/settings.autopilot.json and the frontmatter of every agent, skill and command
# under .claude/ (subdirectories too: Claude Code scans .claude/agents/ recursively), for every entry of every event:
#   1. it is a `command` hook with `onFailure: "block"`, not run in the background (`async`/`asyncRewake`, which
#      the field does not apply to, per the hooks reference);
#   2. its command is `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh [arguments without shell syntax]`, an
#      executable file there,
#      with a row in test-hooks.sh's FAILS_CLOSED table (that table proves the hook exits 2 when it fails; the
#      test fails a hook of the directory without a row, this one a hook that is wired but not in the table);
#   3. neither settings file sets `disableAllHooks`;
#   4. every guard an agent's frontmatter runs has its session-level twin in both settings files (backlog #0-164,
#      ADR-0041): the same hook, on the same matcher, with the same arguments after `--agent <names>`, whose names
#      are exactly the agents whose frontmatter runs it, so every hook a frontmatter uses as a guard must accept
#      `--agent` (frontmatter hooks are documented for agents of the Agent
#      tool, not for the agents a Workflow spawns; a twin keyed on agent_type covers those). A frontmatter hook
#      takes no `--agent`; a twin naming an agent whose frontmatter has no such guard is stale;
#   5. every session-level guard of REQUIRED below is wired in its settings file, on a matcher that covers its
#      tools (#0-164 AC4): a deleted entry, or one moved to another matcher, would pass the rules above.
# The YAML and JSON are parsed, not matched as text: a field one indent off, or in flow style, is what Claude
# Code reads, so it is what this reads. A file that does not parse, a frontmatter that does not close, a hooks
# block of another shape and a key repeated in one map fail the check. Of a repeated key Ruby keeps the last
# value, and which one Claude Code's parser keeps (or whether it refuses the file) is not documented: `onFailure`
# written twice could pass here and not hold there, so no file may repeat a key (review round 2).
#
# What it does not see: whether an agent that should have a guard has one in its frontmatter (a new agent with
# Bash and no readonly-bash.sh is the reviewer's to catch), and a hook a session gets from elsewhere (the user's
# own settings, a plugin).
# Usage: ruby check-hook-entries.rb [<repository root>] (Factory guards, after test-hook-entries.sh).
# Runs on the Ruby of .ruby-version (ADR-0040).

# Tests for scripts/factory/preflight.sh's reading of main's CI result (backlog #0-148), of Claude Code's
# version (backlog #0-162 PR 2: 2.1.295 or newer, the running binary's), and of where and how the session was started
# (backlog #0-194, ADR-0052: the devcontainer, the bot's identity, the firewall, main's settings.autopilot.json and
# the limits it sets), in a temporary repository with gh, docker, claude and curl replaced by stubs on PATH (the
# real .ai/runs/ is never touched). Every case runs in the environment of a correct session (exported below) unless
# it unsets or changes one variable.
#
# The gh stub answers `gh run list` from a list of runs, newest first, filtered the way GitHub filters
# them: `--branch` by the run's head branch, `--event` by its event, then `--limit`. That is what made
# #0-148 possible: a fork pull request's run from a branch named `main` has head branch `main` too, and
# without `--event push` it was "the latest CI run on main".
# Run: .github/scripts/test-preflight.sh   (also run by .github/workflows/factory-guards.yml)

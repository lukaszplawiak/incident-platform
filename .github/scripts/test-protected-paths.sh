# Tests for .github/scripts/check-protected-paths.sh: it passes on the repository's own files and fails when
# the settings miss a deny rule, when the hook lets a write through, when CODEOWNERS misses an owner-only
# path, or when the list cannot be read; and, the other way (backlog #0-168), when a copy protects a path the
# list lacks, or the hook's line is not one flat alternation. Those cases name the message they must give, so a
# case cannot pass on another rule's refusal.
# Run: .github/scripts/test-protected-paths.sh   (also run by .github/workflows/factory-guards.yml)

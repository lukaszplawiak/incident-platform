# PreToolUse (Bash) in the frontmatter of the implementers (implementer, implementer-light): refuse a command run in
# the background (`run_in_background: true`). The implementer's turns are its budget (`maxTurns`); a command in the
# background returns at once, and the agent then spends a turn on every look at its output.
#

#                                        ADR-0041; check-hook-entries.rb keeps the two equal)
#
# Fixed (backlog #0-206): run wf_c1597fde-23e (#0-199) started a full `verify` in the background and checked its
# output with `grep` 26 times; the implementer spent its 120 turns, ended without an answer and the run stopped with
# the lock held. A test the implementer runs blocks until it ends (the Bash tool's timeout reaches 10 minutes), and
# the gate the autopilot trusts is its own scripts/factory/run-tests.sh after the implementer anyway.
# Fails closed.
